DEVELOPMENT

* Make sure you are in the root of this project.
* Run the server: 'make server'
* Your web browser opens to http://localhost:8080
  * You may need to reload once.
* Edit, create docs as normal.

DEPLOYMENT

* run 'make clean && make deploy'
  * this builds the site and places everything into 'build'
  * this command also uses the current branch for the app engine version name
  * this command will then deploy the site
* You will probably need to grab a unique password from your Google Account settings.
  * Save this into the App Engine Launcher during the first deployment.
