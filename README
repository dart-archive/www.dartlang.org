CONFIGURING YOUR MAC SYSTEM

  * You can use brew (if you're on a Mac) or RVM (if you're on Mac or Linux)
* Ensure you have Python 2.7.
  * On a mac? You might want the binary install of Python at http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/
* Open a new Terminal.
* run 'sudo gem install bundler'
* run 'sudo bundle install' from the root of your dartlang project
* install Pygments
  * sudo easy_install Pygments
* Download and install the App Engine launcher: https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads
  * Tell App Engine to use Python 2.7 if it's not
    * It will say, in the log "you're using 2.6"
    * On a Mac?
      * Go to Preferences, and enter the direct path to the Python 2.7 binary,
      which you downloaded from http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/
        * The full path is /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2.7

DEVELOPMENT

* Make sure you are in the root of this project.
* Run the server: 'make server'
* Your web browser opens to http://localhost:8080
  * You may need to reload once.
* Edit, create docs as normal.

DEPLOYMENT

* run 'make clean && make deploy'
  * this builds the site and places everything into 'build'
  * this command also uses the current branch for the app engine version name
  * this command will then deploy the site
* You will probably need to grab a unique password from your Google Account settings.
  * Save this into the App Engine Launcher during the first deployment.

REGENERATING DARTISANS PLAYLISTS

Did you just run a Dartisans? Good for you! Here's what you need to do:

1. Update the description to be present tense (instead of future), to remove the
   link to the moderator page.
1. Ensure the episode is added to the Dartisans playlist, owned by
   Google Developers channel.
1. Sort the playlist by date.
1. Ensure your episode explicitly sets a Recorded On date.
1. Format your episode's title like this: "Dartisans ep. XX: Subtitle Here"
1. Pick a great image thumbnail. Don't use the static Dart logo.
1. Now run `make dartisansplaylist`
1. Test it, commit, and go!
