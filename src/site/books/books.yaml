  desc: 'Aprende Dart is the first book written in Spanish. It was written 
        thinking in programmers who want to learn this new programming language 
        but also thinking in web designers and how Dart can interoperate 
        perfectly with HTML5 and CSS3.
        With this book you will know the language, how the tools work and 
        you will see the core functions and libraries. We will show you the 
        history behind Dart and how it comes to us. We will develop some 
        UI animations samples for web, work with web services, server side 
        Dart programs and the new Polymer.dart library for the new HTML UI 
        web components generation.

        Aprende Dart es el primer libro escrito en Español para toda la 
        comunidad de programadores de habla hispana que quieren conocer 
        y aprender este nuevo lenguaje de programación. También se ha 
        pensando en todos los diseñadores web que, cansados de pelear 
        con JavaScript, quieran desarrollar sus proyectos con este nuevo 
        lenguaje, que funciona en los navegadores web modernos y que 
        interactúa perfectamente con HTML5 y CSS3.
        Con este libro podrás conocer el lenguaje, aprenderás a manejar 
        las herramientas y trabajaremos con las principales funciones y 
        librería. Conocerás la historia que hay tras el lenguaje y cómo 
        surge, crearemos algunos ejemplos de animaciones para interfaces 
        gráficas en la web y trabajaremos con servicios web, veremos el 
        potencial que nos brinda Dart trabajando en el lado servidor y 
        comenzaremos a trabajar con Polymer.dart.'

        Dart for Hipsters teaches you the fastest way possible: with real
        code and real projects starting on page 1. The unabashed goal of

        powerful. And Dart for Hipsters is the fast-paced, most thorough way
        to learn it. You’ll explore the ins and outs of Dart by writing a
        simple application that grows in complexity from modest beginnings
        to a separate library that fully leverages the power of Dart.
        Caution: after reading you may develop an intense attachment to
        structured code and skinny jeans.'
