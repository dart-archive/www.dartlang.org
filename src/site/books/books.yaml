  desc: 'Psst! You’re not stuck with JavaScript anymore.
        Dart for Hipsters teaches you the fastest way possible: with real
        code and real projects starting on page 1. The unabashed goal of
        Dart is to make programming for the Web simpler, faster, and more
        powerful. And Dart for Hipsters is the fast-paced, most thorough way
        to learn it. You’ll explore the ins and outs of Dart by writing a
        simple application that grows in complexity from modest beginnings
        to a separate library that fully leverages the power of Dart.
        Caution: after reading you may develop an intense attachment to
        structured code and skinny jeans.'

        examples showing how to use it as a viable replacement for Java and JavaScript
        in browser-based desktop and mobile applications. It begins with a rapid
        overview of the Dart language and tools including features like interacting with
        the browser, optional typing, classes, libraries, and concurrency with
        isolates. After you master the core concepts, you move on to running Dart on
        the server and creating "single page" HTML5 web applications.'
