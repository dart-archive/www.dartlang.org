## Step 1: Install Dart

We recommend that [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) be used to manage your Dart
installation. To install the Dart SDK and Dartium with Homebrew, run:

{% prettify huge %}
brew tap dart-lang
brew install dart
brew install dartium  # ignore if you're only building server apps
{% endprettify %}

At the very minimum, you need to download the Dart SDK.  Besides the Dart VM,
and the Dart libraries, the SDK bundle contains the command-line Dart tools:
[dart](/tools/dart-vm/), [dart2js](/tools/dart2js/),
[dartanalyzer](/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch04-tools-dart_analyzer.html),
[pub](/tools/pub/), and [docgen](docgen/).

If you are writing web-based apps, you should download Dartium.  Dartium is a
special build of Chromium that includes a Dart VM so that you can test and
debug your applications without first compiling them to JavaScript.

### Manual Download

If you are not using Homebrew, you can still download and install Dart manually:

<a
    data-bits="32" data-os="macos" data-tool="sdk"
    class="download-link"
    href="{{ site.custom.downloads.dartarchive-stable-url-prefix }}/latest/sdk/dartsdk-macos-ia32-release.zip">
  Download Dart SDK
</a>
for Mac. If you need a bigger heap or access to much more memory, download the
<a
    data-bits="64" data-os="macos" data-tool="sdk"
    class="download-link"
    href="{{ site.custom.downloads.dartarchive-stable-url-prefix }}/latest/sdk/dartsdk-macos-x64-release.zip">
  64-bit Dart SDK
</a>
for Mac.

Once the download is complete, extract the Dart SDK, and add the extracted
`bin/` directory to your `PATH`. For example, if the SDK was downloaded into
your `Downloads/` directory, and you want to extract the SDK into your home
directory, you can run:

{% prettify bash %}
$ unzip ~/Downloads/dartsdk-macos-ia32-release.zip -d ~
$ ls ~/dart-sdk
README        bin           include       lib           revision      util          version
$ export PATH=~/dart-sdk/bin:$PATH
$ which dart
/Users/<username>/dart-sdk/bin/dart
{% endprettify %}

To permanently add the Dart SDK to your PATH, add the
`export PATH=~/dart-sdk/bin:$PATH` line to your shell's startup file, such as
`~/.bashrc`.

<a
    data-bits="32" data-os="macos" data-tool="dartium"
    class="download-link"
    href="{{ site.custom.downloads.dartarchive-stable-url-prefix }}/latest/dartium/dartium-macos-ia32-release.zip">
  Download Dartium
</a> for Mac. The Dartium binary expires after 12 weeks. When that happens,
you will need to download a new copy to continue using Dartium.

Once the download is complete, unzip the download to find the Dartium
executable inside.
