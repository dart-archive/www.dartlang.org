## Download Dart

The Dart Editor bundle is the recommended way to get started with Dart on
Windows. When you download the Dart Editor bundle, you get everything you need
to create, edit, test, and build both web-based and server-side applications.

{% include downloads/_dart-editor.html buttonclass="btn-primary" %}

The Dart Editor bundle includes:

* Dart Editor - A powerful tool for editing, debugging, and running Dart
  applications.
* Dartium - A special version of Chromium that includes the Dart VM. You can
  use Dartium to test and debug your Dart web applications.
* The SDK includes the Dart VM, and the Dart libraries,
  and the command-line Dart tools: [dart](/tools/dart-vm/),
  [dart2js](/tools/dart2js/),
  [dartanalyzer](/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch04-tools-dart_analyzer.html),
  [pub](/tools/pub/), and [docgen](docgen/).

## Or download just what you need

### Download just the Dart SDK

At the very minimum, you need to download the Dart SDK. Besides the Dart VM,
and the Dart libraries, the SDK bundle contains the command-line Dart tools:
[dart](/tools/dart-vm/), [dart2js](/tools/dart2js/),
[dartanalyzer](/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch04-tools-dart_analyzer.html),
[pub](/tools/pub/), and [docgen](docgen/).

</p>

### Download just Dartium

If you are writing web-based apps, you should download Dartium.  Dartium is a
special build of Chromium that includes a Dart VM so that you can test and
debug your applications without first compiling them to JavaScript.

{% include downloads/_dartium.html buttonclass="btn btn-primary btn-lg download-btn" %}

The Dartium binary expires after 12 weeks.  When that happens, you will need to
download a new copy to continue using Dartium.
