At a minimum, you need the Dart SDK.

<p class="os-choices">
{% include downloads/_sdk.html buttonclass="btn btn-primary btn-lg" %}
</p>

If you're writing a web app, we recommend getting
[Dartium](/tools/dartium/), as well:

{% include downloads/_dartium.html buttonclass="btn btn-primary btn-lg" %}
