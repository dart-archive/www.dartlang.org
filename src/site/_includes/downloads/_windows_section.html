## Step 1: Download the Dart SDK

At the very minimum, you need to download the Dart SDK. This is the only Dart
bundle that you need. Besides the Dart VM, and the Dart libraries, the SDK
bundle contains the command-line Dart tools: [dart](/tools/dart-vm/),
[dart2js](/tools/dart2js/),
[dartanalyzer](/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch04-tools-dart_analyzer.html),
[pub](/tools/pub/), and [docgen](docgen/).

## Step 2: Download Dartium

If you are writing web-based apps, you should download Dartium.  Dartium is a
special build of Chromium that includes a Dart VM so that you can test and
debug your applications without first compiling them to JavaScript.

The Dartium binary expires after 12 weeks.  When that happens, you will need to
download a new copy to continue using Dartium.
