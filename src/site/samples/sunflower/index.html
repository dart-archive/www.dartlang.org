<h1>{{ page:title }}</h1>

<p>
  The <a href="https://code.google.com/p/dart/source/browse/branches/bleeding_edge/dart/samples/#samples%2Fsunflower">full source code</a> for this sample is available. You can also <a href="sunflower.html">run the sample</a>. Note that it uses the HTML5 range input control, which works only in Chrome.
</p>

<p>The Sunflower sample uses HTML5 Canvas to render an image resembling the head of a sunflower. </p>

<p>The easiest way to create a page layout for a static UI like this one is to use HTML directly. 
Here is the HTML for the Sunflower sample, which includes heading text, the Canvas object, an 
HTML5 range input (slider), and an image showing the equations used to render the sunflower.</p>

<p>Note that the script tag includes source of type application/dart. This allows you
to run the script directly in a browser that supports Dart.
For browsers that do not have an embedded Dart VM, you can also use <a href="/docs/dart2js/">dart2js</a> to compile this app to JavaScript. The <code>dart.js</code> file is used to bootstrap a Dart app into most web browsers,
by replacing <code>sunflower.dart</code> with <code>sunflower.dart.js</code>.</p>

<p>Whether you run Dart natively or compile it to JavaScript, Dart code execution begins when 
the DOM is ready (on DOMContentLoaded).</p>

<p>Now let's look at the Dart code.</p>

{% highlight dart %}
library sunflower;

import 'dart:html';
import 'dart:math';

const SEED_RADIUS = 2;
const SCALE_FACTOR = 4;
const TAU = PI * 2;

const MAX_D = 300;
const ORANGE = "orange";

num centerX, centerY;
int seeds = 0;

var PHI;

main() {
  PHI = (sqrt(5) + 1) / 2;

  CanvasElement canvas = query("#canvas");
  centerX = centerY = MAX_D / 2;
  var context = canvas.context2d;

  InputElement slider = query("#slider");
  slider.on.change.add((Event e) {
    seeds = int.parse(slider.value);
    drawFrame(context);
  }, true);

  seeds = int.parse(slider.value);

  drawFrame(context);
}
{% endhighlight %}
  
<p>By convention, source file names end with ".dart". Code execution begins
  with the main() method and does not require any arguments. Sunflower's
  main() method sets up the Canvas, registers an event handler, and draws
  the first frame.</p>

<p>The Sunflower file declares several constants and variables which are
  explicitly typed. Use of explicit types supports tooling, but Dart also
  allows untyped (<code>dynamic</code>) variables using the keyword
  &quot;var&quot; instead of a type. The <code>num</code> type is an abstract
  class. It looks like a
  primitive because it's lowercase, but Dart has no primitives. Instead,
  num is the base type from which both int and double are derived. Using
  num eliminates the need to explicitly convert from int to double and vice versa.</p>

<p>Dart provides thin wrappers around the DOM which we can use to obtain
  references to elements in the page. The Sunflower constructor calls query()
  to obtain the Canvas and range input objects using their IDs from the HTML file.</p>

<p>Notice the event handler <code>on.change.add</code>, inside the main()
  function, that runs whenever the value of the slider changes. The block of
  code inside the curly braces is a <code>closure</code>, a function which can
  be passed around as a variable. This construct, familiar to JavaScript
  developers, is less verbose than Java's anonymous inner classes familiar
  to GWT developers.</p>

<p>Finally, let's take a look at the methods that actually draw on the Canvas.</p>

{% highlight dart %}
/**
 * Draw the complete figure for the current number of seeds.
 */
void drawFrame(CanvasRenderingContext2D context) {
  context.clearRect(0, 0, MAX_D, MAX_D);

  for (var i = 0; i < seeds; i++) {
    var theta = i * TAU / PHI;
    var r = sqrt(i) * SCALE_FACTOR;
    var x = centerX + r * cos(theta);
    var y = centerY - r * sin(theta);

    drawSeed(context, x, y);
  }

  displaySeedCount(seeds);
}

/**
 * Draw a small circle representing a seed centered at (x,y).
 */
void drawSeed(CanvasRenderingContext2D context, num x, num y) {
  context.beginPath();
  context.lineWidth = 2;
  context.fillStyle = ORANGE;
  context.strokeStyle = ORANGE;
  context.arc(x, y, SEED_RADIUS, 0, TAU, false);
  context.fill();
  context.closePath();
  context.stroke();
}

void displaySeedCount(num seedCount) {
  query("#notes").text = "${seedCount} seeds";
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The drawFrame() method does all the calculations, and drawSeed() paints
  on the Canvas (actually, the CanvasRenderingContext2D). Dart generates
  DOM bindings automatically from the browser's IDL, which means you can
  use a good HTML5 reference like <a href="http://html5rocks.com">HTML5
  ROCKS</a> or <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org">Mozilla Developer
  Network</a> to write Dart code that interacts with the DOM.</p>

<p>By combining HTML layout with a dynamically typed language,
  Dart makes it quick and easy to create rich user interfaces.</p>
