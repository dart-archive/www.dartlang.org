A port of the examples used in the
[Image Filters with Canvas](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/imagefilters/)
article by Ilmari Heikkinen, originally published on HTML5Rocks.

The article describes how to use image filters with an HTML5 Canvas element.
It explains how to process pixels, run simple filters, and blur,
sharpen and emboss an image using convolution filters.

You can open the example in Dart Editor and run it by clicking `index.html`.
