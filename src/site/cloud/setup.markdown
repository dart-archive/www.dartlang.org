## What do you need?

App Engine Managed VMs rely on [Docker](https://www.docker.io)
to develop and deploy applications to the cloud.
Docker is a portable, lightweight runtime and a cloud service for sharing
applications, and is a Linux-only technology.
If you are not developing on Linux, you need a Linux VM to use Docker.
These instructions use
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), a cross-platform virtualization
application, to host a Linux VM.

The Google Cloud SDK provides a local App Engine development server
that provides the same environment locally as in the cloud&mdash;it
distributes incoming requests, provides APIs, and so on.

<img src="images/insidevirtualbox.png" style="display:block;margin: 0 auto;" alt="Docker, boot2docker and VirtualBox running together">

The instructions on this page show you how to install and configure
the following required software:

Dart
: The Dart Editor bundle contains
  everything you need to create, edit, test,
  and build the web-based and server-side applications
  you can deploy to App Engine Managed VMs.

Virtual Box version 4.3.10 or later
: VirtualBox hosts the docker VM daemon
  and runs all the docker containers.

boot2docker
: `boot2docker` is a pre-packaged Linux VM image for 
  VirtualBox. This image contains a docker daemon installation,
  as well as the `boot2docker` command line tool.

docker
: The `docker` command line tool talks to the docker
  daemon running inside VirtualBox.

Google Cloud SDK
: The Google Cloud SDK contains all App Engine tools and
  commands, including the `gcloud` command line tool. All functionality is
  available through the `gcloud preview app` sub-commands.

## Download and install Dart

  [Download Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/download.html)
  and unzip the ZIP file,
  which creates a `dart` directory.

  Put `dart/dart-sdk/bin` in your PATH.

On Mac OS:
<pre>
$ export PATH=$PATH:<i>&lt;installation directory&gt;</i>/dart/dart-sdk/bin
</pre>

On Windows:
<pre>
&gt; set PATH=%PATH%;C:<i>&lt;installation directory</i>&gt;/dart/dart-sdk/bin
</pre>

On Linux:
<pre>
$ export PATH=${PATH}:<i>&lt;installation directory&gt;</i>/dart/dart-sdk/bin
</pre>

## Setup instructions

<p class="os-choices">
  Below are the
  instructions for
  {% include os-choices.html %}
</p>

<!--------------------- MAC ------------------------------------>

<div class="macos" markdown="1">

### Download and install Docker and related tools
{: .no_toc}

  Run the boot2docker installer from
  <a href="https://github.com/boot2docker/osx-installer/releases" target="_blank">Github</a>.
  This downloads and installs the following tools on your development machine:

* VirtualBox (installed in `Applications` folder)
* `boot2docker` command (installed in `/usr/local/bin`)
* `docker` command (installed in `/usr/local/bin`)

<aside class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
**Note:**
These instructions assume that v1.3.1 of Docker and boot2docker 
are installed on your machine.
However, Docker 1.3.0 is required inside the boot2docker VM.
The configuration of boot2docker below handles this.
</aside>

### Configure Docker
{: .no_toc}

  <ol markdown="1">
  <li markdown="1">Run the following commands to configure `boot2docker`.
<pre>
$ mkdir ~/.boot2docker
$ echo 'ISOURL = "https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/releases/download/v1.3.0/boot2docker.iso"' > ~/.boot2docker/profile
$ boot2docker init
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Run the following command to launch boot2docker.
<pre>
$ boot2docker up
</pre>

When successful, the command prints some setup information.
You don't need to type these commands if you use the command in the
following section.
  </li>

  <aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  **Tip:** After running this command, launch VirtualBox.
  You should be able to see boot2docker running.
  </aside>
  </ol>

### Get the Docker images
{: .no_toc}

<ol markdown="1">
  <li markdown="1">Call the following script to set the required environment
      variables: `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY`, `DOCKER_HOST`, and `DOCKER_CERT_PATH`.

<pre>
$ $(boot2docker shellinit)
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Run the following command to download a number of Docker images.
      This can take awhile.
<pre>
$ docker pull google/docker-registry
</pre>
  </li>

  <li>Check to make sure that you have some images:
<pre>
$ docker images
</pre>
  This command lists a number of images.
  </li>

  <li>Run the following command which prints version information about the
      Dart VM. This requires that the boot2docker VM is running.

<pre>
$ docker run google/dart /usr/bin/dart --version
</pre>
  </li>
</ol>

### Set up a cloud project {#set-up-a-cloud-project-mac}
{: .no_toc}

You need an App Engine project to develop and deploy
an application to App Engine.
Go to the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com">Google Developer
Console</a> and follow the instructions for creating a project.
Give it a unique name.

### Install Google Cloud SDK
{: .no_toc}

You need a Google account, like gmail, to use the Google Cloud SDK.

You need to grant certain permissions to Google Cloud SDK
to use the tools included in it.
During the setup instructions below,
you use the `gcloud auth login` command to login into your gmail account.
The command launches a browser with a list of permissions
for you to grant.

The list is sufficient to use any of the tools included in the Cloud SDK.
Your credentials do not expire (that is, you do not need to re-run this command),
but you can repeat this process as many times as you'd like to add more accounts.
Use `gcloud config set account` to set the active one.

<ol markdown="1">
  <li>To install the Google Cloud SDK, follow the instructions
    given in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/#Quick_Start">Installing
    the Cloud SDK</a> and then return to these instructions.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Google Cloud SDK has the beta features on.
    So if you are already using the Cloud SDK,
    you don't need to do anything special to use the beta features.

    If you are not yet using the Google Cloud SDK,
    add <i>google-cloud-sdk/bin</i> to your path.
  </li>
  <li markdown="1"> Now login, set the project,
    and install the Managed VMs support.
    Replace <i>my-project-name</i> with your project name chosen
    in [Set up a cloud project](#set-up-a-cloud-project-mac).

<pre>
$ gcloud auth login
$ gcloud config set project <i>my-project-name</i>
$ gcloud components update app
</pre>
  </li>
  <li> Run this command to show the current configuration.
<pre>
$ gcloud config list
</pre>
The output should look something like this:
<pre>
[core]
account = mem@example.com
project = <i>my-project-name</i>
user_output_enabled = True
</pre>
  </li>
</ol>
</div>

<!--------------------- WINDOWS ------------------------------------>
<div class="windows" markdown="1">

### Download and install Docker and related tools
{: .no_toc}

* Go to the Docker website and follow the
  <a href="http://docs.docker.com/installation/windows/">
  installation instructions</a>.
  This installs VirtualBox, docker,
  the boot2docker management tool, and a few other
  programs you need.

<aside class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
**Note:**
These instructions assume that v1.3.1 of Docker and boot2docker 
are installed on your machine.
However, Docker 1.3.0 is required inside the boot2docker VM.
The configuration of boot2docker below handles this.
</aside>

* Put the VirtualBox tool, VBoxManage, in your path.
  The default installation directory is
  `C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\`. 

### Configure Docker
{: .no_toc}

<strong>Note</strong>: On Windows,
the docker commands below should be 
run inside the VM as the installation process does not install
a Windows docker command line tool.

  <ol markdown="1">
  <li markdown="1">Run the following commands to configure `boot2docker`.
<pre>
> mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\.boot2docker"
> echo ISOURL = "https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/releases/download/v1.3.0/boot2docker.iso" > "%USERPROFILE%\.boot2docker\profile"
> "%ProgramFiles%\Boot2Docker for Windows\boot2docker" init
</pre>
  </li>
  <li markdown="1">Run the following command to launch boot2docker.
<pre>
> "%ProgramFiles%\Boot2Docker for Windows\boot2docker" up
</pre>

When successful, the output should include lines similar to the following:

<pre>
Docker client does not run on Windows for now. Please use
  "C:\Program Files\Boot2Docker for Windows\boot2docker.exe" ssh
to SSH into the VM instead.
</pre>
  </li>

  <aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  **Tip:** After running this command, launch VirtualBox.
  You should be able to see boot2docker running.
  </aside>
  </ol>

### Get the Docker images
{: .no_toc}

<ol markdown="1">
<li markdown="1"> `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY`, `DOCKER_HOST`, and `DOCKER_CERT_PATH`.
   Unfortunately, boot2docker does not support Windows that well here.

First, run the following command:

<pre>
> "%ProgramFiles%\Boot2Docker for Windows\boot2docker.exe" ssh
</pre>

This prints three lines like this:

<pre>
    export DOCKER_HOST=...
    export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=...
    export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=...
</pre>

If you are using the normal Windows shell, take each of these commands
and replace `export` with `set`. For example, for `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY`:

<pre>
set DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
</pre>

If you are using a cygwin shell, you can use the following script:

<pre>
$ $(boot2docker shellinit)
</pre>

</li>

<li markdown="1">Run the following commands to download a number of Docker
   images.  The `docker pull` command can take awhile.

<pre>
> "%ProgramFiles%\Boot2Docker for Windows\boot2docker.exe" ssh
$ docker pull google/docker-registry
</pre>
</li>

<li markdown="1"> Check to make sure that you have some images:

<pre>
$ docker images
</pre>

This command lists a number of images.
</li>

<li markdown="1"> Run the following command to print the version of the
    Dart VM. This requires that the boot2docker VM is running.

<pre>
$ docker run google/dart /usr/bin/dart --version
</pre>

The output will look something like the following:

<pre>
Dart VM version: 1.7.2 (Tue Oct 14 12:12:42 2014) on "linux_x64"
</pre>
</li>

<li markdown="1"> Leave the boot2docker VM:

<pre>
$ exit
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
