The CPU profile tells you how the virtual
machine (VM) has been spending its time when executing an isolate.
The following video gives a brief overview of Observatory with some
specific tips on how to use the profiling feature.

<iframe style="display:block;margin: 0 auto;" width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Ww8ISWzZGRE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Observatory achieves this by _sampling_ the isolate at regular intervals.
The sampled data is aggregated and displayed in a _profile tree_.

When Observatory samples the isolate, it saves the sampled data
in a ring buffer, called the _profile_, which can hold up to 
two minutes worth of data.  Once the buffer becomes full,
the oldest samples are replaced with new samples.

**For Windows users:** Observatory's [CPU Profile](cpu-profile.html)
screen is disabled by default.  Specify the
[<code>--profile</code>](/tools/dart-vm/#observatory) option when
you launch your app to enable it.
</aside>

At the top of the screen, a summary tells you a bit about
how the data was gathered:

<img src="images/CPU-profile.png" alt="CPU profile screen">

Timestamp
: The time of the last profile refresh.

Time span
: The time span of the profile data. The profile buffer holds a maximum
  of two minutes worth of samples.

Sample count
: The number of samples in the profile.

Sample rate
: How often the isolate is sampled. The default, 1000 Hz, samples the
  isolate once per millisecond.

Sample depth
: How many levels into the stack the sampling is performed.
  The default is 8 stack frames deep. Sampling begins at the
  currently executing (bottommost) stack frame and walks up
  the stack towards `main()`.

Display cutoff
: If a function or tag uses less of the CPU than this percentage,
  it is not displayed.  The default display cutoff is 0.02%.

Tags
: Tags represent the different activities of the VM.
  This pulldown lets you control whether you want to see tags and
  how they should be displayed. For more information, see
  [Displaying tags](#displaying-tags).

## Profile tree {#profile-tree}

Below the summary is a two-column profile tree that reflects the
activity of the sampled isolate.
Each row in the tree is a [VM tag](#vm-tags),
a [user tag](#user-tags), or a function.
A function can be native (C/C++) code or Dart code.
You can expand or collapse nodes in the tree by clicking the
arrows to the left.

The percentages on the left are the percent of calls to the parent.
These percentages add up to 100%.
The percentages on the right show the percentage of samples where
the tag was active, or where the function was executing.

The following screenshot shows a sample profile tree with tags suppressed
so that only function calls are displayed.

<aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
**Note:** Hovering over a row in the tree brings up a tool tip with more
information about that entry. In the previous screenshot,
the tool tip gives information about the top entry.
</aside>

Because tags are hidden in the previous example,
each row contains a function. The functions
are listed in order from most CPU intensive to least.

The first row in the previous screenshot shows the
`ContactSolver.solveVelocityConstraints` function.
The percentage on the left shows that
this function used 4.12% of the root isolate's CPU time.
The percentage on the right shows that 4.12% of the samples
were taken while this function was active.

Note that, for the topmost level of the tree, the percentages
in the right column are the same as those in the left column.

Clicking an arrow to the left of a function expands the tree to show
the calling function.
You can drill down the stack 8 levels deep, or until you reach the
`main` function, whichever comes first.

While this information is useful, it is difficult to understand,
at a high level, what is really going on.  To help make sense of this
information, tags are used to impose structure on the data
so that you can more easily interpret where the VM is spending its time.

## Tags {#tags}

Tags help you understand the big picture of what is going on in
an isolate.  Observatory supports two kinds of tags.
_VM tags_ are predefined by Observatory, and _user tags_
are custom tags that you create in your Dart code.

### Inspecting VM tags {#inspecting-vm-tags}

Observatory sorts the VM's activities into categories of
execution by labeling each activity with a predefined tag,
called a VM tag. (These are also called Default tags.)

The only VM tag that you have direct control over is the Script tag,
which indicates time spent executing your Dart code.  The other categories
(Native, Compile, VM, Runtime, GCNewSpace, and GCOldSpace)
are activities performed by the VM on behalf of your application,
such as compilation. For more information on these tags,
see [User and VM Tags](tags.html).

The following screenshot shows a sample profile tree with the
Default node expanded to show the activity of the VM tags:

<img src="images/VM-tags.png" alt="A list of the default VM tags">

In the previous example, the VM has spent 35.26% of its time executing
the application's Dart code. If you expand the Script node,
the functions labeled with the Script tag are displayed, 
listed from most CPU intensive to least. The following screenshot
shows the first 11 rows of the Script subtree:

<img src="images/VM-tags-detail.png" alt="A list of the default VM tags, with the Script tag expanded">

The first function listed under the script tag,
`DynamicTree._query`, used 11.23% of the entire Script category.
Also, 3.96% of all samples were made while this function was executing.

This is a rather flat profile tree where the activity is distributed
throughout the category&mdash;no single function is using most of the CPU time.

### Defining user tags {#defining-user-tags}

You can also label your code with custom tags, called _user tags_, using the
[dart:profiler](https://api.dartlang.org/apidocs/channels/be/dartdoc-viewer/dart-profiler) library.

For more information, see [User and VM tags](tags.html).

### Configuring tag display {#configuring-tag-display}

Use the **Tags** pulldown to configure how the profile tree displays tags.

User > VM
: The default. User-defined tags are displayed at
the top level of the profile tree, as siblings to the Default category.
The tags are listed from most CPU intensive to least.
When you expand a top-level tag, you see the VM tags underneath.

User
: The top level is the same as for **User > VM**, with the user-defined
tabs listed as siblings to the Default category. However, when you
expand a top-level tag, you see function calls listed, from most CPU
intensive to least.

VM > User
: Lists the VM tags only at the top level. When you expand a VM tag,
you see both default and user tags listed.

VM
: Lists the VM tags only. User tags are hidden.

None
: Hides all tags. The functions are displayed from most CPU intensive to least.

## Stubs

### InlineCacheStub / SubtypeTestCacheStub

The first time a function is run, it is compiled without optimizations. Each call site or type test has a cache that remembers the results of method lookup or type tests for the concrete classes actually encountered. This avoids repeated lookups and collects type feedback for the optimizing compiler. If these stubs are high on your profile, your program is spending a lot of time in unoptimized code. This could be because your program executes a lot of different code with a low frequency that doesnâ€™t trigger optimization. Or it could be because something about your program caused the optimizing compiler to bail out (try --trace_deoptimization).
