# Dart plugin from JetBrains

## For WebStorm, IntelliJ IDEA, PhpStorm, PyCharm, and RubyMine

The [Dart plugin][plugin] for [WebStorm][ws] JavaScript IDE offers advanced support
for the Dart language. This plugin is also available for other IntelliJ
Platform-based IDEs: IntelliJ IDEA, PhpStorm, PyCharm, and RubyMine. It provides
intelligent coding assistance for Dart and allows developers to debug, run and
test Dart applications right in the IDE.

For developers looking for a more complete development experience with Dart,
WebStorm and other JetBrains IDEs provide integration with VCS, configurable
deployment, and a smart code editor with support for a wide range of
technologies for web development.

## Plugin Features
