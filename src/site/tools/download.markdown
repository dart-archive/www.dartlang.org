# Getting and Installing Dart Is Easy!

{% include default_toc.html %}

<p class="os-choices">
Confirm your platform: 
 {% include os-choices.html %}
</p>

You have two options for downloading Dart.

## Option 1: Choose the complete bundle {#whole_enchilada}

When you download the Dart Editor bundle, you get everything you
need to create, edit, test, and build both web-based and server-side
applications.

The Dart Editor bundle includes:

* Dart Editor - A powerful tool for editing, debugging, and running Dart
  applications.
* Dartium - A special version of Chromium that includes the Dart VM.
You can use Dartium to test and debug your Dart web applications.
* SDK - The software developers kit includes the Dart Virtual Machine,
  the Dart libraries, and all the command line tools used behind the
  scenes by the Dart Editor:

  * [dart](/tools/dart-vm/) - the standalone VM
  * [dart2js](/tools/dart2js/) - the Dart-to-JavaScript compiler
  * [dartanalyzer](/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch04-tools-dart_analyzer.html) - the static analyzer
  * [pub](/tools/pub/) - the Dart package manager
  * [docgen](docgen/) - the API documentation generator

**Note:** Dart Editor requires Java version 6 or higher.
Problems? See [Troubleshooting Dart Editor](editor/troubleshoot.html).
</aside>

Dart Editor can automatically update itself, along with the SDK and
Dartium, whenever a new integration build is available. To enable
automatic updates, go to **Preferences**, choose **Update**, and select
**Download updates automatically**.

[64-bit Dart + Editor]({{ site.custom.downloads.dartarchive-stable-url-prefix }}/latest/editor/darteditor-macos-x64.zip)
for Mac.

</span>

Once the download is complete, unzip the bundle. Dart is installed!

You can now work through the [Avast, Ye Pirates](/codelabs/darrrt/) code lab.

------

## Option 2: Choose only the software that you need {#a_la_carte}
Perhaps you prefer to use a particular IDE or editor, and don't
require the Dart Editor.

No problem!

At the very minimum, you need to download the Dart SDK.
This is the only Dart bundle that you need. Besides the Dart VM,
and the Dart libraries, the SDK bundle contains the command-line Dart tools:

  * [dart](/tools/dart-vm/) - the standalone VM
  * [dart2js](/tools/dart2js/) - the Dart-to-JavaScript compiler
  * [dartanalyzer](/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch04-tools-dart_analyzer.html) - the static analyzer
  * [pub](/tools/pub/) - the Dart package manager
  * [docgen](docgen/) - the API documentation generator

Note that if you choose the Ã  la carte option you have less to download, but
you will occasionally need to perform a manual update when new
versions of Dart are released.

After downloading the software that you need, you may want to customize your
IDE or text editor by [downloading a plugin](more_downloads.html) that
supports Dart.

<p class="os-choices">
{% include downloads/_sdk.html buttonclass="btn btn-primary btn-lg" %}
</p>

If you are writing web-based apps, you should download Dartium.
Dartium is a special build of Chromium that includes a Dart VM
so that you can test and debug your applications without first
compiling them to JavaScript.

{% include downloads/_dartium.html buttonclass="btn btn-primary btn-lg" %}

The Dartium binary expires after 12 weeks.
When that happens, you will need to download a new copy
to continue using Dartium.

### Dart SDK for Debian and Ubuntu
If you are using the Debian or Ubuntu platform, you might want to
install the [Dart SDK for Debian and Ubuntu with Apt](debian.html).

------

### Note for Linux Users
If your system uses an older version of Ubuntu and you are compiling the
SDK, you may need to update to GCC 4.6 or later.
See the <a href="faq.html">Tools FAQ</a> for more information.

------

### Looking for previous versions?

Previous versions of the Dart SDK, Dartium, and the Dart Editor are available
at the [download archive](/tools/download_archive).
