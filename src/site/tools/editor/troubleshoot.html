  <h2> Getting your system architecture </h2>

  <div class="linux">
    <p>
    If you don't know whether you have 32-bit or 64-bit Linux,
    use the command <code>uname -a</code>.
    If <code>64</code> is in the output,
    you have 64-bit Linux;
    otherwise, you have 32-bit Linux.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="macos">
    <p>
    Almost all Mac OS X systems have a 64-bit OS,
    so we recommend using the 64-bit Dart Editor.
    If you encounter problems,
    try the <a href="#mac-32bit">32-bit version</a>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="windows">
    <p>
    If you don't know whether you have 32-bit or 64-bit Windows, see
    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions">Microsoft's support site</a>.

  <h2> Launching Dart Editor </h2>

<div class="windows">

  <p>
  Your Java version should have the same bit width as
  your Dart Editor version.
  For example, if you're using a 64-bit Dart Editor,
  then you should use 64-bit Java.
  Otherwise, you might see a message like this
  when you try to launch Dart Editor:
  </p>

<pre>
Failed to load the JNI shared library "C:\Program Files(x86)\Java\jre6\\bin\client\jvm.dll
</pre>

    <p>
    You can find the bit width of your default Java version using the command
    <code>java -version</code>.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="linux">
  <section id="linux-32bit">
  <p>
  If you're using 64-bit Linux but have 32-bit Java libraries,
  Dart Editor won't work.
  </p>

  <p>
  The fix: Use a 64-bit Java JDK.
  You can get a 64-bit JDK 7 from
  <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-se-jdk-7-download-432154.html"
    target="_blank">Java SE Development Kit 7 Downloads</a>.
  If you already have a 64-bit JDK but it's not the default,
  you can specify the Java runtime.

  A few things can go wrong when launching Dart Editor on a Mac:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li> <a href="#security-preferences">Unidentified developer</a>
      </li>
    <li> <a href="#corruption">"DartEditor.app" is damaged (64-bit only)</a>
      </li>
    <li> <a href="#java-install">Java installation failure</a>
      </li>
    <li> <a href="#avstartup">Slow startup</a>
      </li>
    <li> <a href="#mac-32bit">32-bit Mac</a>
      </li>
  </ul>


  <section id="security-preferences">
  <h3>Unidentified developer</h3>

  <p>
  If you're running Mac OS 10.8 (Mountain Lion),
  your computer might refuse to start Dart Editor
  because it's not from the Mac App Store or an identified developer.
  Until we fix this problem
  (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=5088">bug
  #5088</a>),
  you can work around it.
  </p>

  <p>
  <img src="images/mac-permission-error.png"
    alt="Dialog text: DartEditor can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer."
    style="border: 1px solid black">
  </p>

  <p>
  The easiest workaround:
  When launching Dart Editor for the first time,
  don't double-click the Dart Editor icon.
  Instead, right-click (or Ctl+click) it to bring up a context menu,
  and choose <b>Open</b>.
  Then, in the dialog that comes up, click <b>Open</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
  An alternative workaround is to change your security settings.
  Go to <b>System Preferences > Security & Privacy</b>.
  In the <b>General</b> tab under
  <b>Allow applications downloaded from:</b>,
  choose <b>Anywhere</b>.
  You should now be able to start Dart Editor.
  Once you've run Dart Editor,
  you can change the preference back to its previous setting.
  </p>
  </section>

  <section id="corruption">
  <h3>"DartEditor.app" is damaged (64-bit only)</h3>

  <p>
  Sometimes when you try to launch a new, 64-bit build of Dart Editor,
  Mac OS X incorrectly displays a corruption warning:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  "DartEditor.app" is damaged and can't be opened.
  You should move it to the Trash.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  The workaround is to download and install the
  <a class="download-link" data-bits="32" data-os="macos" data-build="integration" href="{{ site.custom.downloads.dartarchive-stable-url-prefix }}/latest/editor/darteditor-macos-ia32.zip">
  32-bit version of Dart Editor</a>.
  </p>

  <section id="java-install">
  <h3>Java installation failure</h3>

  <p>
  When you try to run Dart Editor but don't have a Java SE 6 runtime,
  Dart Editor offers to install Java for you.
  If the installation doesn't work,
  you can either restart Dart Editor or
  <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572">install Java yourself</a>.
  </p>

  </section>

  <section id="avstartup">
  <h3>Slow startup</h3>

  <p>
  If you use Sophos Anti-Virus,
  Dart Editor (like most Java applications)
  starts up 10-15 times slower than normal.

  <p>
  The fix: Turn off scanning of the app's JAR files.
  For example:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li> In Sophos Anti-Virus preferences,
      choose <b>On-access Scanning</b>. </li>
    <li> If the preferences are locked,
      click the lock and enter your password. </li>
    <li> Click <b>Excluded Items</b> and then the <b>+</b> sign. </li>
    <li> Navigate to the directory that contains <code>DartEditor</code>. </li>
    <li> Search for files under that directory
      with names that end in <code>.jar</code>. </li>
    <li> Select all these <code>.jar</code> files,
      and click Open. </li>
  </ol>

  </section>


  <section id="mac-32bit">
  <h3>32-bit Mac</h3>

  <p>
  If you're using one of the increasingly rare 32-bit Macs,
  you can't launch the 64-bit version of Dart Editor.
  Instead, you see a warning like this:
  </p>

  <p>
  <img src="images/mac-installerror.png"
    alt="Dialog text: You can't open the application DartEditor.app because it's not supported on this type of Mac."
    style="border: 1px solid black"
    width="419" height="161" >
  </p>

  <p>
  The fix: Download and install the
  <a class="download-link" data-bits="32" data-os="macos" data-build="integration" href="{{ site.custom.downloads.dartarchive-stable-url-prefix }}/latest/darteditor-macos-ia32.zip">
  32-bit version of Dart Editor</a>.
  </p>

  </section>

</div> <!-- end of mac-only section -->

  <section id="runtime">
  <h3>Specifying the Java runtime</h3>

  <p>
  If necessary, you can specify the Java runtime that Dart Editor uses.
  Go to your Dart installation directory and
  add the following two lines to <code>DartEditor.ini</code>
  immediately <b>before</b> the existing
  <code>&#x2011;vmargs</code> line:
  </p>

<pre>-vm
<em>/full/path/to/java</em>
</pre>

<div class="windows">
  <p>
  <b>Important:</b>
  On Windows, use double backslashes (<code>\\</code>)
  as the directory separator:
  </p>

<pre>-vm
c:\\bin\\java_jdk1.7.0\\bin\\javaw.exe
</pre>
</div>

  <p>
  For example, <code>DartEditor.ini</code> might have:
  </p>

<pre>...
-vm
/usr/local/buildtools/java/jdk-64/bin/java
-vmargs
...
</pre>

</section>
</section>


<section id="dartium">
  <h2>Launching Dartium</h2>

    <p>
    By default,
    when you click Dart Editor's Run button
    <img src="images/run.png" alt="Run" width="16" height="16"
    style="vertical-align:top">,
    your web app runs in Dartium.
    If you instead see a message that
    you need to download a new version of Dartium,
    your software is old.
    </p>

    <p>
    The fix: <a href="/tools/editor/#download">Download</a> and install a new version of
    <b>Dart Editor</b>.
    You'll get an updated version of Dartium, plus the
    <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/search/label/editor">latest improvements to Dart Editor</a>.
    Alternatively, download a new version of
    <a href="/tools/dartium/">Dartium</a>
    and substitute it for the copy that's in your
    Dart installation directory.
</section>


<section id="eclipse">
  <h2>Using Eclipse</h2>

  <p>
  If Dart Editor and Eclipse
  share the same <code>workspace</code> directory,
  they'll save conflicting settings,
  resulting in warnings and errors from both
  Dart Editor and Eclipse.
  </p>

  <p>
  The fix: Don't use the Dart installation directory
  for any other Eclipse-based software.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="clear">
  <h2> Clearing all settings </h2>

  <p>
  Dart Editor settings are in a platform-dependent directory,
  so you don't lose them when you update Dart Editor.
  If your settings become corrupted
  or you want to see the new user experience,
  delete the settings directory.
  </p>

  <p>
    The following table shows where Dart Editor settings are saved.
  </p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th> Platform </th> <th> Location of settings </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> Windows&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
      <td> <code><em>&lt;user's home directory&gt;</em>\DartEditor</code> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> Linux </td>
      <td> <code>$HOME/.dartEditor</code> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> Mac </td>
      <td> <code>$HOME/Library/Application Support/DartEditor</code> </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
