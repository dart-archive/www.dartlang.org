## Getting Dart Editor {#download}

<p>
Dart Editor is in the Dart download for
{% include os-choices.html %}
See <a href="/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch01.html#ch01-editor">Up and Running</a>
for help with downloading and launching Dart Editor.

<aside class="alert alert-info">
  <b> Problems? </b>
  See <a href="troubleshoot.html">Troubleshooting Dart Editor</a>.
</aside>

<p>
  {% include downloads/_dart-editor-continuous.html %}
</p>

<p>
The default version of Dart Editor
is the <em>stable build</em>.
It's automatically updated about once every six weeks.
The
<a target="_blank"
  href="{{ site.custom.downloads.dartarchive-stable-url-prefix }}/latest/changelog.html">change log</a>
has a list of release dates and features.
The <em>dev channel build</em>, on the other hand, is the
latest tested version of the Dart Editor which contains the newest features but may still contain some bugs.
If you use the dev channel build, please get new builds frequently,
and send feedback about new features and bugs that you encounter.
</p>


### Updating {#update}

<p>
  Dart Editor can automatically update itself,
  along with the SDK and Dartium,
  whenever a new integration build is available.
  To enable automatic updates,
  go to <b>Preferences</b>, choose <b>Update</b>, and
  select <b>Download updates automatically</b>.
</p>

<p>
  If you'd rather choose when to update,
  make sure <b>Download updates automatically</b> is not selected.
  Then when you're ready to update,
  use the <b>About Dart Editor</b> dialog
  to download and apply updates.
</p>


## Installing Dart Editor {#install}

<p>
  Unzip the file you downloaded. You're done!
</p>

<p>
  Want to use command-line tools, as well?
  You already have them, thanks to the Dart download including the SDK.
  However, you might want to set environment variables,
  as described in the <a href="/tools/sdk/">SDK page</a>.
</p>


## Using Dart Editor {#using}

To get started with Dart Editor,
read these:

[Get Started](http://www.dartlang.org/docs/tutorials/get-started/) (the first tutorial in the _Dart Tutorials_)
: Gently introduces you to Dart Editor,
  from downloading it to creating and running apps.

[Up and Running](/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch01.html#ch01-editor) (a section from Chapter 1 of _Dart Up and Running_)
: Quickly leads you through downloading Dart Editor,
  running a sample,
  and creating an app.

For details on _using_ Dart Editor,
read this:

[Dart Editor](/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch04-tools-editor.html) (a section from Chapter 4 of _Dart Up and Running_)
: Teaches how to use Dart Editor—for example,
  how to set up launches for different browsers.


## Customizing the build {#build}

You can add behavior to the Dart Editor build process
by creating a build.dart file.
For example,
Web UI uses a build.dart file to run custom tools over Dart and HTML files
and to map from the original files to the generated files.
See [Build.dart and the Dart Editor Build System](build.html)
for details on implementing your own build.dart file.


## Features {#features}

  <p>
    Dart Editor,
