**Support for new language features:**
To use new language support for asynchrony (such as async functons
and await expressions) or for enumerated types, you must opt in.
For more information, see
[the troubleshooting page](troubleshoot.html#new-features).

## Installing Dart Editor

[Download Dart Editor](/downloads/), if you haven't already.

Dart Editor requires the Java runtime.
[Download the JRE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/),
if needed. Dart Editor requires JRE 6.0 or later.

However, you might want to set environment variables,
as described in the [SDK page](/tools/sdk/).
{% endcomment %}

The default version of Dart Editor is the _stable build_.
It's automatically updated about once every six weeks. The
<a target="_blank"
  href="{{ site.custom.downloads.dartarchive-stable-url-prefix }}/latest/changelog.html">change log</a>
has a list of release dates and features.

The _dev channel build_, on the other hand, is the
latest tested version of the Dart Editor which contains the newest
features but may still contain some bugs.
If you use the dev channel build, please get new builds frequently,
and send feedback about new features and bugs that you encounter.

<aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
Want to use the command-line tools, as well?
You already have them, thanks to the Dart download including the
[SDK](/tools/sdk/).
</aside>

## Updating Dart Editor

Dart Editor can automatically update itself,
along with the SDK and Dartium,
whenever a new integration build is available.
To enable automatic updates,
go to **Preferences**, choose **Update**, and
select **Download updates automatically**.

If you'd rather choose when to update,
make sure **Download updates automatically** is not selected.
Then when you're ready to update,
use the **About Dart Editor** dialog
to download and apply updates.

## Using Dart Editor

To get started with Dart Editor, read these:

* [Get Started](http://www.dartlang.org/docs/tutorials/get-started/)
   (the first tutorial in the _Dart Tutorials_)<br>
   Gently introduces you to Dart Editor,
   from downloading it to creating and running apps.

* [Up and Running](/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch01.html#up-and-running)
  (a section from Chapter 1 of _Dart Up and Running_)<br>
  Quickly leads you through downloading Dart Editor, running a sample,
  and creating an app.

For details on _using_ Dart Editor, read this:

* [Tips for Using Dart Editor](using.html)<br>
  Teaches how to use Dart Editor&mdash;for example,
  how to set up launches for different browsers.

## Features

Dart Editor, with its static analysis engine
and direct integration with Dartium,
helps you develop, debug, and maintain your apps.

## Customizing the build

You can add behavior to the Dart Editor build process
by creating a build.dart file. 
See [Build.dart and the Dart Editor Build System](build.html)
for details on implementing your own build.dart file.

<aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
**Note**:
For the most part, `build.dart` has been replaced by pub transformers.
Pub uses transformers to transform a package's assets before serving the app.

To learn how to use transformers, see
[Assets and Transformers](/tools/pub/assets-and-transformers.html).
To learn how to write a transformer, see
[Writing a Pub Transformer](/tools/pub/transformers/).
