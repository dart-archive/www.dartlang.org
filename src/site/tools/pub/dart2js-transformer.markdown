# {{ page.title }}

The [pub serve](cmd/pub-serve.html) and [pub build](cmd/pub-build.html)
commands use the [dart2js](/tools/dart2js/) compiler to convert your
Dart files to JavaScript.

You can configure dart2js in the [pubspec](/tools/pub/pubspec.html)
for your package.
To do this, add `$dart2js` (note the leading dollar sign) under the
`transformers:` field.

For example, by default, `pub` minifies an app when in release mode
(`pub build` defaults to `release` mode), but not otherwise
(`pub serve` defaults to `debug` mode).
The following example ensures that pub minifies the app in all situations:

{% prettify yaml %}
transformers:
- $dart2js:
    minify: true
{% endprettify %}

## Options {#options}

The following options are available. For more information on how these options
work, see the [documentation](/tools/dart2js/#options) for dart2js:

{% prettify yaml %}
transformers:
- $dart2js:
    checked: true
    minify: true
    verbose: true
    environment: {name: value, ...}
    analyzeAll: true
    suppressWarnings: true
    suppressHints: true
    terse: true
    csp: true
{% endprettify %}

## Excluding an asset {#exclude-assets}

You can also exclude a particular asset, or set of assets,
from being processed by a transformer.
You can also configure a transformer to run
only on a particular asset, or set of assets.
For more information, see
[How to exclude assets](assets-and-transformers.html#exclude-assets) in
[Pub Assets and Transformers](assets-and-transformers.html).

## Special-case option {#additional-options}

`commandLineOptions: [...args...]`

In addition to the options previously listed, `commandLineOptions`
is available as a fallback for cases where a new command line option has
been added to dart2js, but a corresponding configuration option has not
yet been added to pub.
