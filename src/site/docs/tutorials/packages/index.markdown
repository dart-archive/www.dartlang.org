Now that you're able to create and run a Dart application
and have a basic understanding of DOM programming,
you are ready to leverage code written by other programmers.
Many interesting and useful packages of reusable Dart code
are available at the
<a href="http://pub.dartlang.org/">pub.dartlang.org</a>
repository.

This target shows you how to use `pub`&mdash;a package manager
that comes with Dart&mdash;to
install one of the packages in the repository,
the vector_math package.
You can follow these same steps to install any package hosted at
<a href="http://pub.dartlang.org/">pub.dartlang.org</a>;
just change the package name when you get to that step.
This target also describes some of the resources you can expect to find
in a well-built package.

##Create a new application within a package {#new-app-with-pkg}

To use an external package,
your application must itself be a package.
You can create an application and its package together
from the New Application window in Dart Editor.

Start Dart Editor and bring up the **New Application** window.
Use vector_victor for the application name.
Select **Add Pub support** to make Dart Editor
generate basic package support.
Click **Finish**.

![Select **Add pub support** to use packages](images/create-victor.png)

Dart Editor creates a new directory with boilerplate files.
Notice that the directory contains a new kind of file:
the `pubspec.yaml` file.
Double click pubspec.yaml to view its contents.

![Dart Editor with pubspec.yaml file](images/victor-files.png)

The pubspec.yaml file is what makes the vector_victor directory a package.
This file contains the package specification written in YAML
(visit <a href="http://pub.dartlang.org/doc/pubspec.html">Pubspec Format</a>
for in-depth coverage).
At minimum, the pubspec provides a name for the package.
It also can provide a description and identify packages on
which this package depends.

![The default pubspec.yaml file specifies name and description](images/pubspec.png)

Any application with a valid pubspec.yaml file in its top-level directory
is a package and can therefore use external packages.

##...Or put an existing application into a package {#old-app-in-pkg}

If you already have an application
and want it to use an external package,
simply create a pubspec.yaml file in the application's top-level directory.
Your pubspec.yaml file must at least specify the package name.

![The smallest possible pubspec.yaml](images/minimalpubspec.png)

<aside class="alert">
<strong>Tip:</strong> If you are using
Dart Editor to create the pubspec.yaml file,
you might get an error message
when you first create the empty pubspec.yaml file.
This is because Dart Editor runs pub automatically and
is trying to resolve the package specification file,
which at first has nothing in it.
Ignore the message,
add the required name field,
and save the pubspec.yaml file.
</aside>

##Name the package dependencies {#name-dependencies}

To use an external library package,
include it in a list of _dependencies_
in your application's pubspec.yaml file.
Each item in the dependencies list
specifies the name, and sometimes the version,
of a package that your application uses.

To specify that vector_victor depends on
the vector_math package,
modify the pubspec.yaml file as shown below.
Be sure to remove the hash marks (#) so that
the dependencies list is not commented out.
Also, YAML is whitespace sensitive;
it's important to indent the package name.

![A pubspec with dependency on the vector_math package](images/pubspec-vectormath.png)

`any` means that this application can use
any version of the vector_math package.
You could instead specify a particular version of the package.
When versioning becomes important to your project,
check out
<a href="http://pub.dartlang.org/doc/versioning.html">
Pub's Versioning Philosophy
</a>.

<a href="http://pub.dartlang.org/">pub.dartlang.org</a>
is the primary public repository for Dart packages.
`pub` automatically checks that
website when resolving package dependencies.
To use one of the packages from that site,
you can specify it by its simple name,
as we have done here.

##Install the package dependencies {#install-dependencies}

In Dart Editor, save pubspec.yaml with **File > Save**.
When you save the file,
Dart Editor automatically runs
<a href="http://pub.dartlang.org/doc/pub-install.html">pub install</a>,
which recursively installs the Dart libraries
from the packages in the dependencies list.
You can also select **Pub Install** from the **Tools** menu in Dart Editor.

Pub puts the libraries in a directory called packages
under the application's top-level directory.
Click the wee arrow to expand the packages directory.
There you will find the vector_math directory,
which links to the Dart libraries from the vector_math package.

![Pub Install finds and installs required packages](images/run-pub-install.png)

In addition,
you will notice the unittest directory;
unittest is another package in the repository.
vector_math depends on unittest
(unittest is listed in vector_math's dependencies list)
so pub installs it as well.
Pub install works recursively and installs
all of the required packages
of your application and its dependencies.

Pub install also creates a file called pubspec.lock,
which identifies the specific versions of the packages that were installed.
This helps to provide a stable development environment.
Later you can modify the version constraints and use `pub update`
to update to new versions as needed.

##What did you get (and not get)? {#about-packages}

Besides the Dart libraries,
the vector_math package has other resources that might be useful to you
that do not get installed into your application directory.
Let's take a step back for a moment to look at what
you got and where it came from.

To see the contents of the vector_math package,
visit the
<a href="https://github.com/johnmccutchan/DartVectorMath" target="_blank">
Dart vector math repository
</a>
at GitHub.
Although many files and directories are in the repository,
only one, `lib`, was installed when you ran pub install.

##Import libraries from a package {#use-package}

Open the vector_math directory by clicking the little arrow.

![Finally, the vector_math library files](images/the-vectormath-library.png)

The directory contains two Dart files,
each of which defines a different library.
As with the SDK libraries,
use the import directive to use code from an installed library.
The Dart SDK libraries are built-in and
are identified with the special dart: prefix.
For external libraries installed by pub,
use the `package:` prefix.

{% prettify dart %}
import 'package:vector_math/vector_math_browser.dart';
{% endprettify %}

Note that you specify the filename, not the library name.
