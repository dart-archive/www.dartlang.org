HTTP (Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol) is a communication protocol used
to send data from one program to another over the internet.
At one end of the data transfer is a server
and at the other end is a client.
The client is often browser-based
(either a user typing in a browser or a script running in a browser),
but might also be a standalone program.

The server _binds_ to a host and port (it
makes an exclusive connection to an IP address and
a port number).
Then the server listens for requests.
Because of Dart's asynchronouse nature,
the server can handle many requests at a single time,
as follows:

* Server listens
* Client connects
* Server accepts and receives request (and continues to listen)
* Server can continue to accept other requests
* Server writes response of request or several, possibly interleaved, requests
* Server finally ends(closes) the response(s).

In Dart,
the
<a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_io.html"
   target="_blank">dart:io</a>
library contains
the classes and functions you need to write HTTP
clients and servers.
In addition, the
<a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/http_server"
   target="_blank">http_server</a> package
contains some higher-level classes that make it easier to write
clients and servers.

<aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
<strong>Important:</strong>
_Browser-based programs **cannot** use the dart:io library._

The API in the dart:io library
work _only_ with standalone, command-line programs.
They do not work in the browser.
To make HTTP requests from a browser-based client
refer to the
<a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_html/HttpRequest.html"
   target="_blank">dart:html HttpRequest</a> class.
</aside>

This tutorial provides several examples that show how easy
it is to write Dart HTTP servers and clients.
Beginning with the hello world of servers,
you learn how to write the code for a server
from binding and listening to responding to requests.
You also learn about the client-side: making different
kinds of requests (GET and POST),
writing browser-based and command-line clients.

##Get the source code

<ul>
  <li>
    Get the Dart Tutorials
    <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-tutorials-samples/archive/master.zip">
      example code.
    </a>
  </li>

  <li markdown="1">
In Dart Editor, open the `bin/httpserver` directory, which contains
the sources you need for this tutorial.
  </li>
</ul>

**Note:** These examples are compatible with Dart 1.3.

##Run the hello world server {#run-hello-world}

_Example file for this section:
<a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-tutorials-samples/blob/master/bin/httpserver/hello_world_server.dart"
   target="_target">hello_world_server.dart</a>._

Let's begin with a small server that responds to all requests
with the string `Hello, world!`

<ul>

  <li markdown="1">
In the `bin/httpserver` directory,
right-click `hello_world_server.dart`
and choose **Run** from the menu.

![The hello world server is listening for requests.](images/hello_world_listening.png)
  </li>

  <li markdown="1">
Then, in any browser, enter `localhost:4040`.
The browser displays `Hello, world!`

![The response from the hello world server.](images/hello_world_response.png)
  </li>
</ul>

In this case, the server is a Dart program
and the client is the browser you used.
However, you can write client programs in Dart&mdash;either
a browser-based client script, or a standalone program.

###A quick glance at the code

In the code for the hello world server,
an HTTP server binds to a host and port,
listens for HTTP requests, and writes a response.
Note that the program imports
the `dart:io` library, which contains the HTTP-related
classes both for server-side programs and for
client-side programs (but not for browser-based scripts).

{% prettify dart %}
[[highlight]]import 'dart:io';[[/highlight]]

main() {
  HttpServer.bind(InternetAddress.LOOPBACK_IP_V4, 4040)
      .then((HttpServer server) {
    print('listening on localhost, port ${server.port}');
    server.listen((HttpRequest request) {
      request.response.write('Hello, world!');
      request.response.close();
    });
  }).catchError((e) => print(e.toString()));
}
{% endprettify %}
<div class="prettify-filename">hello_world_server.dart</div>

The next few sections cover server-side binding,
making a client-side GET request,
listening, and responding.

##Binding a server to a host and port {#binding}

_Example for this section: hello_world_server.dart._

The first line of code in `main()`
uses `HttpServer.bind()` to create an
<a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_io/HttpServer.html"
   target="_blank">HttpServer</a>
object and bind it to a host and port.

{% prettify dart %}
HttpServer.bind([[highlight]]InternetAddress.LOOPBACK_IP_V4[[/highlight]], [[highlight]]4040[[/highlight]])
    .then(([[highlight]]HttpServer server[[/highlight]]) {
  ...
{% endprettify %}
<div class="prettify-filename">hello_world_server.dart</div>

The `bind()` method uses a Future to run asynchronously.
When the bind is successful, the callback of `then()`
is called with the new HttpServer object as a parameter.

### Hostname
The first parameter of `bind()` specifies the hostname.
You can specify a particular hostname or IP address as a String.
Alternatively, you can specify the host using these predefined values
provided by the
<a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_io/InternetAddress.html"
   target="_blank">InternetAddress</a> class:

| Value | Use case |
|---|---|
| LOOPBACK_IP_V4<br/>_or_<br/>LOOPBACK_IP_V6 | The server listens for client activity on the loopback address, which is effectively localhost. Uses either version 4 or 6 of the IP protocol. These are used primarily for testing. We recommend that you use these values instead of `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`. |
| ANY_IP_V4<br/>_or_<br/>ANY_IP_V6 | The server listens for client activity on the specified port on any IP address. Uses either version 4 or 6 of the IP protocol. |
{: .table}

By default, when using a V6 internet address,
a V4 listener is used as well.

### Port

The second parameter to `bind()` is an integer
that specifies the port.
The port uniquely identifies a service on the host computer.
Port numbers below 1024 are reserved (except for 0)
for standard services.
For example, FTP data transfer typically runs on port 20,
quote of the day on port 17, and HTTP on port 80.
Your program should use port numbers from 1024 and higher.
If the port is already in use,
the connection for your server will be refused.

### Listening for requests

The server begins listening for requests by calling the
`listen()` method.
For each received request, the callback of `listen()`,
highlighted below, is called with an
<a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_io/HttpRequest.html"
   target="_blank">HttpRequest</a>
object.

{% prettify dart %}
...
server.listen([[highlight]](HttpRequest request) {[[/highlight]]
  [[highlight]]request.response.write('Hello, world!');[[/highlight]]
  [[highlight]]request.response.close();[[/highlight]]
[[highlight]]}[[/highlight]]);
...
{% endprettify %}
<div class="prettify-filename">hello_world_server.dart</div>

You'll learn more about what the HttpRequest object contains
and how to write the response in the section
[Listening for and handling requests](#httprequest-object).
But first, let's look at one way a client generates a request.

##Using HTML forms to make GET requests {#using-forms-to-make-get-requests}

_Example files for this section:
<a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-tutorials-samples/blob/master/bin/httpserver/number_thinker.dart"
   target="_blank">number_thinker.dart</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-tutorials-samples/blob/master/bin/httpserver/make_a_guess.html"
   target="_blank">make_a_guess.html</a>._

This section features a command-line server that
randomly chooses a number between 0 and 9.
The client is a basic HTML web-page, `make_a_guess.html`,
that you can use the to guess the number.

<hr> 
<strong>Try it!</strong>

<ul>
  <li markdown="1">
  **Run the number thinker server**

  In Dart Editor, right-click `number_thinker.dart`
  and choose **Run** from the menu.

![The number thinker server is listening for requests.](images/number_thinker_thinking.png)

  </li>

  <li markdown="1">
  **Open the HTML page**

  In Dart Editor, right-click `make_a_guess.html`
  and select **Run in Dartium**.

  </li>
  <li markdown="1">
  **Make a guess**

  Choose a number and press the **Guess** button.

![The user makes a guess using a pull-down menu.](images/guessing.png)

  Note the components of the URL on the results page.

![The components of a URL.](images/url.png)

  </li>
</ul>
<hr>

No Dart code is involved in the client.
The client request is made from the browser
to the Dart server through an HTML form
within make_a_guess.html,
which provides an automatic way to formulate and send client HTTP requests.
The form contains the pull-down list and the button.
The form also specifies the URL, which includes the port number,
and the kind of request (the _request method_).
It might also include elements that build a query string.
(To learn more about forms, see
[Get Input from a Form](/docs/tutorials/forms/).)

Here's the HTML code for the form in make_a_guess.html:

{% prettify html %}
[[note]]1[[/note]] <form [[highlight]]action="http://localhost:4041"[[/highlight]]
[[note]]2[[/note]]       [[highlight]]method="GET"[[/highlight]]>

[[note]]3[[/note]]   <select [[highlight]]name="q"[[/highlight]]>
        <option value="0">0</option>
        <option value="1">1</option>
        <option value="2">2</option>
        ...
        <option value="9">9</option>
      </select>
[[note]]4[[/note]]   <input [[highlight]]type="submit"[[/highlight]] value="Guess">
    </form>
{% endprettify %}
<div class="prettify-filename">make_a_guess.html</div>

<span class="code-note">1</span>
URL to send the request to.

<span class="code-note">2</span>
The kind of request, here a `GET` request. Other common
kinds of requests include POST, PUT, and DELETE.

<span class="code-note">3</span>
Any element within the form that has a name becomes
a parameter in the query string.

<span class="code-note">4</span>
When pressed, the submit button formulates
the request based on the content of the form and sends it.

### A RESTful GET request

REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is a set of principles
for designing Web services.
Well-behaved HTTP clients and servers observe the REST principles
defined for GET requests.

A GET request:

* only retrieves data
* doesn't change the state of the server
* has length limits
* can send query strings in the URL of the request

The client in this example makes a REST-compliant GET request.

## Listening for and handling requests {#httprequest-object}

_Example files for this section:
number_thinker.dart and make_a_guess.html._

Now that you've seen the browser-based client for this example,
let's take a look at the Dart code for the number thinker server,
starting with `main()`.
Once again the server binds to a host and port.
Here, the callback of `then()`
is a top-level function
named `listenForRequests()`.

{% prettify dart %}
import 'dart:io';
import 'dart:math' show Random;

int myNumber = new Random().nextInt(10);

void main() {
  print("I'm thinking of a number. $myNumber");
  HttpServer.bind(InternetAddress.LOOPBACK_IP_V4, 4041)
            .then([[highlight]]listenForRequests[[/highlight]])
            .catchError((e) => print (e.toString()));
}
...
{% endprettify %}
<div class="prettify-filename">number_thinker.dart</div>

The code for `listenForRequests()` calls `listen()` so that
the HttpServer starts to listen on the host and port for requests.
When a request comes in, the server creates an HttpRequest object
and passes it to the callback of `listen()`.
Thus, as requests come in, the HttpServer object provides
a stream of HttpRequest objects.
Note that the HttpServer class implements
<a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_async/Stream.html"
   target="_blank">Stream</a>.

{% prettify dart %}
    ...
    listenForRequests(HttpServer _server) {
[[note]]1[[/note]]   _server.listen([[highlight]](HttpRequest request) {[[/highlight]]
       [[highlight]] ...[[/highlight]]
     [[highlight]] }[[/highlight]],
[[note]]2[[/note]]   [[highlight]]onDone[[/highlight]]: () => print('Done with requests.'),
[[note]]3[[/note]]   [[highlight]]onError[[/highlight]]: (e) => print(e.toString() );
    }
    ...
{% endprettify %}
<div class="prettify-filename">number_thinker.dart</div>

The `listen()` method takes one required and two optional parameters:

<span class="code-note">1</span>
A callback function, which is called for each client request.

<span class="code-note">2</span>
`onDone` is called when the server is shut down.

<span class="code-note">3</span>
`onError` is called if an error occurs.


An HttpRequest object has many properties that provide
information about the request.
The following table lists some useful properties:

| Property | Information |
|---|---|
| `method` | A String: 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', and so on. |
| `uri` | A  <a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/Uri.html" target="_blank">Uri</a> object: scheme, host, port, query string, and other information about the requested resource. |
| `response` | An <a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_io/HttpResponse.html" target="_blank">HttpResponse</a> object: where the server writes its response. |
| `headers` | An <a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_io/HttpHeaders.html" target="_blank">HttpHeaders</a> object: the headers for the request, including <a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_io/ContentType.html" target="_blank">ContentType</a>, content length, date, and so on. |
{: .table}

### Using the method property

The code below from the number thinker example uses the HttpRequest `method`
property to determine what kind of request has been received.
This server handles only GET requests.

{% prettify dart %}
listenForRequests(_server) {
  _server.listen((HttpRequest request) {
    if ([[highlight]]request.method == 'GET'[[/highlight]]) {
      handleGet(request);
    } else {
      request.response.statusCode = HttpStatus.METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED;
      request.response.write("Unsupported request: ${request.method}.");
      request.response.close();
    }
  },
  onDone: () => print('No more requests.'),
  onError: (e) => print(e.toString()) );
}
{% endprettify %}
<div class="prettify-filename">number_thinker.dart</div>

### Using the uri property

Typing a URL into a browser generates a GET request,
which simply requests data from the specified resource.
It can send a minimal amount of data along with the request
through a query string attached to the URI.

{% prettify dart %}
void handleGet(HttpRequest request) {
  String guess = [[highlight]]request.uri[[/highlight]].queryParameters['q'];
  ...
}
{% endprettify %}
<div class="prettify-filename">number_thinker.dart</div>

Use the `uri` property from the HttpRequest object to get a
<a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/Uri.html"
   target="_blank">Uri</a> object
that contains the information about the URL typed by the user.
The `queryParameters` property of the Uri object is a Map containing
the components of the query string.
Refer to the desired parameter by name.
This example uses `q` to identify the guessed number.

### Setting the status code for the response

The server should set the status code to indicate the success or
failure of the request. Earlier you saw the number thinker set
the status code to `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED` to reject non-GET requests.
Later in the code,
to indicate that the request was successful and the response is complete,
the number thinker server sets the HttpResponse status code to `HttpStatus.OK`.

{% prettify dart %}
void handleGet(HttpRequest request) {
  String guess = request.uri.queryParameters['q'];
  [[highlight]]request.response.statusCode = HttpStatus.OK[[/highlight]];
  ...
}
{% endprettify %}
<div class="prettify-filename">number_thinker.dart</div>

`HttpStatus.OK` and `HttpStatus.METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED` are
one of many pre-defined status codes in the
<a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_io/HttpStatus.html"
   target="_blank">HttpStatus</a> class.
Other useful pre-defined status codes are
`HttpStatus.METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED`
and
`HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND` (your classic 404).

In addition to `statusCode`,
the HttpResponse object has other useful properties:

| Property | Information |
|---|---|
| `contentLength` | The length of the response. -1 means the length is not known in advance. |
| `cookies` | A List of <a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_io/Cookie.html" target="_blank">Cookie</a>s to set in the client. |
| `encoding` | The <a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_convert/Encoding.html" target="_blank">Encoding</a> used when writing strings, like JSON and UTF-8. |
| `headers` | The response headers, an <a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_io/HttpHeaders.html" target="_blank">HttpHeaders</a> object. |
{: .table}

### Writing the response to the HttpResponse object

Every HttpRequest object has a corresponding HttpResponse object.
The server sends data back to the client through the response object.

Use one of the HttpResponse write methods
(`write()`, `writeln()`, `writeAll()`, or `writeCharCodes()`)
to write the response data to the HttpResponse object.
Or connect the HttpResponse object to a stream via `addStream`
and write to the stream.
Close the object when the response is complete.
Closing the HttpResponse object,
sends the data back to the client.

{% prettify dart %}
void handleGet(HttpRequest request) {
  ...
  if (guess == myNumber.toString()) {
    [[highlight]]request.response.writeln('true')[[/highlight]];
    [[highlight]]request.response.writeln("I'm thinking of another number.")[[/highlight]];
    [[highlight]]request.response.close()[[/highlight]];
    ...
  }
}
{% endprettify %}
<div class="prettify-filename">number_thinker.dart</div>

## Making a POST request from a standalone client {#making-post}

_Example files for this section:
<a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-tutorials-samples/blob/master/bin/httpserver/basic_writer_server.dart"
   target="_blank">basic_writer_server.dart</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-tutorials-samples/blob/master/bin/httpserver/basic_writer_client.dart"
   target="_blank">basic_writer_client.dart</a>._

In the hello world and the number thinker examples,
the browser generated simple GET requests.
For more complex GET requests and other kinds of requests, such
as POST, PUT, or DELETE,
you need to write a client program, of which there are two kinds:

* A standalone client program, which uses
the 
<a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_io/HttpClient.html" target="_blank">HttpClient</a>
class from `dart:io`.

* A browser-based client, which uses API from
<a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_html.html"
   target="_blank">dart:html</a>.
This tutorial does not cover browser-based clients.
To look at code for a browser-based client and
related server, see note_client.dart, note_server.dart,
and take_note.html.
Also, check out the
[Get Input from a Form](/docs/tutorials/forms/) tutorial.)

Let's look at a standalone client, `basic_writer_client.dart`,
and its server `basic_writer_server.dart`.
The client makes a POST request
to save JSON data to a server-side file.
The server accepts the request and saves the file.

<hr> 
**Try it!**

Run the server and client on the command line.

<ul>
  <li markdown="1">
First the server: 

{% prettify bash %}
$ dart bin/httpserver/basic_writer_server.dart
{% endprettify %}
  </li>

  <li markdown="1">
Then the client:

{% prettify bash%}
$ dart bin/httpserver/basic_writer_client.dart
{% endprettify %}
  </li>

  <li markdown="1">
The server writes the data to `file.txt`:

{% prettify bash %}
{"name":"Han Solo","job":"reluctant hero","BFF":"Chewbacca","ship":"Millennium Falcon","weakness":"smuggling debts"}
{% endprettify %}
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

The client creates an HttpClient object and uses the
`post()` method to make the request.
Making a request involves two Futures:

* The `post()` method establishes a network
connection to the server and returns the first Future,
which returns an HttpClientRequest object.

* The client composes the request object and closes it.
The `close()` method sends the request to the server
and returns the second Future.

{% prettify dart %}
   import 'dart:io';
   import 'dart:convert' show UTF8, JSON;

   main() {
     Map jsonData = {
       'name':     'Han Solo',
       'job':      'reluctant hero',
       'BFF':      'Chewbacca',
       'ship':     'Millennium Falcon',
       'weakness': 'smuggling debts'
     };
  
[[note]]1[[/note]]  new HttpClient().[[highlight]]post(InternetAddress.LOOPBACK_IP_V4.host, 4049, '/file.txt')[[/highlight]]
[[note]]2[[/note]]      .then(([[highlight]]HttpClientRequest[[/highlight]] request) {
[[note]]3[[/note]]      [[highlight]]request.headers.contentType = ContentType.JSON;[[/highlight]]
[[note]]4[[/note]]      [[highlight]]request.write(JSON.encode(jsonData))[[/highlight]];
[[note]]5[[/note]]      [[highlight]]return request.close();[[/highlight]]
       })
[[note]]6[[/note]]    .then(([[highlight]]HttpClientResponse response[[/highlight]]) {
[[note]]7[[/note]]      response.transform([[highlight]]UTF8.decoder[[/highlight]]).listen((contents) {
           print(contents);
         });
       });
   }
{% endprettify %}
<div class="prettify-filename">basic_writer_client.dart</div>

<span class="code-note">1</span>
The `post()` method requires the host, port, and the path to the requested
resource.
In addition to `post()`, the HttpClient class provides functions
for making other kinds of
requests, including `postUrl()`, `get()`, and `open()`.

<span class="code-note">2</span>
When the `post()` connection succeeds,
the callback of the first Future receives an
<a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_io/HttpClientRequest.html"
   target="_blank">HttpClientRequest</a>
object.

<span class="code-note">3</span>
An HttpClientRequest object has an HttpHeaders object,
which contains the request headers.
For some headers,
like `contentType`,
HttpHeaders has a property specific to that header.
For other headers, use the `set()` method to
put the header in the HttpHeaders object.

<span class="code-note">4</span>
The client writes data to the request object using `write()`.
The encoding, JSON in this example,
matches the type specified in the ContentType header.

<span class="code-note">5</span>
The `close()` method sends the request to the server
and returns a Future

<span class="code-note">6</span>
When the client receives the response,
the second Future completes with an
<a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_io/HttpClientResponse.html"
   target="_blank">HttpClientResponse</a> object.
In this example, the client program decodes
and prints the text of the response.

<span class="code-note">7</span>
The response from the server is encoded in UTF-8.
Use a transformer defined in the `dart:convert` library
to convert the data into regular Dart string format.

### A RESTful POST request

Similar to GET requests, REST provides guidelines for POST requests.

A POST request:

* creates a resource (in this example, a file)
* uses a URI that has a structure similiar to file and directory pathnames;
for example, the URI has no query string
* transfers data as JSON or XML
* has no state and does not change the state of the server
* has no length limits

<strong>Bonus code:</strong>
If you would like to see some client code that
makes GET requests,
check out the code for `number_guesser.dart`.
It's a standalone client for the number thinker server
that makes periodic guesses until it guesses correctly.

## Handling a POST request in a server {#handling-post}

_Example files for this section:
basic_writer_server.dart and basic_writer_client.dart._

An HttpRequest object is a Stream of lists of bytes (`Stream<List<int>>`).
To get the data sent from the client,
listen for data on the HttpRequest object.

If the request from the client contains a large amount of
data, the data might arrive in multiple chunks.
In our next example, basic_writer_server.dart,
the server writes the chunks to a StringBuffer.
After the server receives all the data,
the callback of `onDone` is called.

![The flow of control in a server processing requests.](images/flowchart.png)

The `basic_writer_server.dart` file implements
a server that follows this pattern.

{% prettify dart %}
   import 'dart:io';
   import 'dart:convert';

   void main() {
    
     HttpServer.bind(InternetAddress.LOOPBACK_IP_V4, 4049).then((server) {
       server.listen((req) {
      
         ContentType contentType = req.headers.contentType;
         BytesBuilder builder = new BytesBuilder();

         if (req.method == 'POST' &&
[[note]]1[[/note]]          [[highlight]]contentType != null &&[[/highlight]]
             [[highlight]]contentType.mimeType == 'application/json'[[/highlight]]) {
           req.listen((buffer) {
[[note]]2[[/note]]          [[highlight]]builder.add(buffer);[[/highlight]]
[[note]]3[[/note]]        }, [[highlight]]onDone:[[/highlight]] {
             // write to a file, get the file name from the URI
             String jsonString = UTF8.decode(builder.takeBytes());
[[note]]4[[/note]]          String filename = [[highlight]]req.uri.pathSegments.last[[/highlight]];
             new File(filename).writeAsString(jsonString,
                 mode: FileMode.WRITE).then((_) {
[[note]]5[[/note]]                Map jsonData = [[highlight]]JSON.decode(jsonString)[[/highlight]];
                   req.response.statusCode = HttpStatus.OK;
                   req.response.write('Wrote data for ${jsonData['name']}.');
                   req.response.close();
                 });
           });
         } else {
           req.response.statusCode = HttpStatus.METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED;
           req.response.write("Unsupported request: ${req.method}.");
           req.response.close();
         }
       });
     });
   }
{% endprettify %}
<div class="prettify-filename">basic_writer_server.dart</div>

<span class="code-note">1</span>
The request object has an HttpHeaders object.
Recall that the client set the `contentType` header to JSON (application/json).
This server rejects requests that are not JSON-encoded.

<span class="code-note">2</span>
A POST request has no limit on the amount of data it can send
and the data might be sent in multiple chunks.
Furthermore, JSON is UTF-8, and UTF-8 characters can be encoded over
multiple bytes.
Therefore, the server uses a
<a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_io/BytesBuilder.html" target="_blank">BytesBuilder</a>
object to collect the data until all the data
is delivered, then the callback of `onDone` is called.

<span class="code-note">3</span>
The callback of `onDone` writes the data to the file
specified by the client in the Uri.

<span class="code-note">4</span>
The URL for the request is `localhost:4049/file.txt`.
The code `req.uri.pathSegments.last` extracts the file name
from the URI: `file.txt`.

<span class="code-note">5</span>
The data sent by the client is JSON formatted.
The server decodes it using the JSON codec available in the
<a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_convert.html" target="_blank">dart:convert</a>
library.

####A note about CORS Headers

If you want to serve clients that are running on a different origin
(a different host or port), you need to add CORS headers.
The following code,
take from note_server.dart,
allows POST and OPTIONS requests from any origin.
Use CORS headers with caution,
because they can open your network up to security risks.

{% prettify dart %}
void addCorsHeaders(HttpResponse res) {
  req.response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
  res.response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'POST, OPTIONS');
  res.response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Headers',
      'Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept');
}
{% endprettify %}
<div class="prettify-filename">note_server.dart</div>

For more information, refer to Wikipedia's article
[Cross-origin resource sharing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing).

##Using the http_server package {#using-http-server-package}

_Example files for this section:
<a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-tutorials-samples/blob/master/bin/httpserver/mini_file_server.dart"
   target="_blank">mini_file_server.dart</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-tutorials-samples/blob/master/bin/httpserver/static_file_server.dart"
   target="_blank">static_file_server.dart</a>._

For some higher-level building blocks,
we recommend that you try the 
[http_server](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/http_server)
pub package,
which contains a set of classes that,
together with the HttpServer class in the `dart:io` library,
make it easier to implement HTTP servers.

In this section, we compare a server written
using API only from dart:io to a server
with the same functionality
written using dart:io together with http_server.

You can find the first server in `mini_file_server.dart`.
It responds to all requests by returning the contents of the
`index.html` file in the same directory as its source.

**Try it!**

<ul>
  <li markdown="1">
Run the server on the command line:

{% prettify bash %}
$ dart bin/httpserver/mini_file_server.dart
{% endprettify %}
  </li>

  <li markdown="1">
Type `localhost:4044` into the browser.
The server displays an HTML file:

![The index.html file served by mini_file_server.dart.](images/index_file.png)

  </li>
</ul>

Here's the code for mini file server:

{% prettify dart %}
import 'dart:io';

main() {
  HttpServer.bind(InternetAddress.LOOPBACK_IP_V4, 4044).then((server) {
    server.listen((HttpRequest req) {
      File file = new File('index.html');
      file.exists().then((bool found) {
        if (found) {
          file.openRead()
              .pipe(req.response)  // HttpResponse type.
              .catchError((e) => print(e.toString()));
        } else {
          req.response.statusCode = HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND;
          req.response.close();
        }
      });
    });
  });
}
{% endprettify %}
<div class="prettify-filename">mini_file_server.dart</div>

This code determines if the file exists,
and if it does, opens the file and pipes the contents
to the HttpResponse object.

The second server,
whose code you can find in 
<a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-tutorials-samples/blob/master/bin/httpserver/basic_file_server.dart"
   target="_blank">basic_file_server.dart</a>,
uses the `http_server` package.

**Try it!**

<ul>
  <li markdown="1">
Run the server on the command line:

{% prettify bash %}
$ dart bin/httpserver/basic_file_server.dart
{% endprettify %}
  </li>

  <li markdown="1">
Type `localhost:4046` into the browser.
The server displays the same index.html file as the previous:

![The index.html file served by basic_file_server.dart.](images/index_file_4046.png)

  </li>
</ul>

In this server, the code for handling the request is much shorter,
because the
<a href="https://api.dartlang.org/apidocs/channels/stable/#http_server/http_server.VirtualDirectory"
   target="_blank">VirtualDirectory</a>
class handles the details of serving the file.

{% prettify dart %}
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:http_server/http_server.dart';

void main() {

  VirtualDirectory staticFiles = new VirtualDirectory('.');
    
  HttpServer.bind(InternetAddress.LOOPBACK_IP_V4, 4046).then((server) {
    server.listen((req) {
      [[highlight]]staticFiles.serveFile(new File('index.html'), req);[[/highlight]]
    });
  });
}
{% endprettify %}
<div class="prettify-filename">basic_file_server.dart</div>

Here, the requested resource, index.html, is served by
the `serveFile()` method in the VirtualDirectory class.
You don't need to write code to open a file, and pipe its contents
to the request.

Below is code for another file server that also uses the http_server
package, `static_file_server.dart`.
This server serves any file from the server's directory
or subdirectory.

Run the file server, either on the command line or in Dart Editor,
and test it with this URL `localhost:4048/file.txt`.
Change `file.txt` to other filenames within the directory.

{% prettify dart %}
    import 'dart:io';
    import 'package:http_server/http_server.dart';
    import 'package:path/path.dart';

    void main() {
      var pathToBuild = join(dirname(Platform.script.toFilePath()));

      var staticFiles = new VirtualDirectory(pathToBuild);
[[note]]1[[/note]]   staticFiles.allowDirectoryListing = true;
[[note]]2[[/note]]   staticFiles.directoryHandler = (dir, request) {
        var indexUri = new Uri.file(dir.path).resolve('index.html');
[[note]]3[[/note]]     staticFiles.serveFile(new File(indexUri.toFilePath()), request);
      };

      HttpServer.bind(InternetAddress.LOOPBACK_IP_V4, 4048).then((server) {
[[note]]4[[/note]]     server.listen(staticFiles.serveRequest);
      });
    }
{% endprettify dart %}
<div class="prettify-filename">static_file_server.dart</div>

<span class="code-note">1</span>
Allows clients to request files within the server's directory.

<span class="code-note">2</span>
An anonymous function that handles requests for the directory itself,
that is, the URL contains no filename.
The function redirects these requests to `index.html`.

<span class="code-note">3</span>
The `serveFile` method serves a file.
In this example, it serves `index.html` for directory requests.

<span class="code-note">4</span>
The `serveRequest` method provided by the VirtualDirectory
class handles requests that specify a file.

##Using https with bindSecure() {#using-https}

_Example for this section:
<a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-tutorials-samples/blob/master/bin/httpserver/hello_world_server_secure.dart"
   target="_blank">hello_world_server_secure.dart</a>._


You might have noticed that the HttpServer class defines a
method called `bindSecure()`, which provides a secure connection
using HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol with Secure Sockets Layer).
To use the bindSecure() method, you need a certificate,
which is provided by a Certificate Authority (CA).
For more information about certificates refer to
[What is SSL and what are Certificates?](http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SSL-Certificates-HOWTO/x64.html)

For illustrative purposes only,
the following server, `hello_world_server_secure.dart`,
calls `bindSecure()` using
a certificate created by the Dart team for testing.
You **must** provide your own certificates for your servers.

{% prettify dart %}
    import 'dart:io';

    main() {
[[note]]1[[/note]]  [[highlight]]var testPkcertDatabase = Platform.script.resolve('pkcert').toFilePath();[[/highlight]]
[[note]]2[[/note]]  [[highlight]]SecureSocket.initialize(database: testPkcertDatabase,[[/highlight]]
         [[highlight]]password: 'dartdart');[[/highlight]]
  
[[note]]3[[/note]]  HttpServer.bindSecure('localhost', 4047,
          [[highlight]]certificateName: 'localhost_cert'[[/highlight]]).then((server) {
        print('listening');
        server.listen((HttpRequest request) {
          request.response.write('Hello, world!');
          request.response.close();
        });
      });
    }
{% endprettify %}
<div class="prettify-filename">hello_world_server_secure.dart</div>

<span class="code-note">1</span>
Get the path to the certificate database.

<span class="code-note">2</span>
Create and initialize a secure socket,
providing the certificate to the socket.

<span class="code-note">3</span>
Use the `bindSecure()` method to bind to a host and port,
providing the name of the certificate.
