To write a Dart web app,
you need to have basic understanding of
several topics&mdash;the DOM tree, nodes, elements,
HTML, Dart language and libraries,
and Dart Editor.

The interdependencies are circular,
but we have to begin somewhere,
so we begin with a simple HTML file,
which introduces the DOM tree and nodes.
From there,
you build a bare bones, stripped-down
Dart application
that contains just enough code to
dynamically put text on the page from the Dart side.
Though simple,
this example shows you how to connect a Dart
app to an HTML page and
one way that a Dart app can interact with items on the page.
These concepts
provide the foundation
for more interesting and useful web apps.

##About the DOM {#dom-intro}

The Document Object Model (DOM)
represents the structure of a web document as a tree of nodes.
When an HTML file is loaded into a browser,
the browser interprets the HTML
and displays the document in a window.
The following diagram shows a simple HTML file and
the resulting web browser page in Chrome.

<img src="images/simple-html.png"
     alt="A simple HTML file and its resulting web page">

HTML uses tags to describe the document.
For example, the simple HTML code above
uses the \<title> tag for the page title,
\<h1> for a level-one header,
and \<p> for a paragraph.
Some tags in the HTML code,
such as
\<head> and \<body>,
are not visible on the web page,
but do contribute to the structure of the document.

In the DOM,
the document object sits at the root of the tree
(it has no parent).
Different kinds of nodes in the tree
represent different kinds of objects in the document.
For example, the tree has page elements,
text nodes, and attribute nodes.
Here is the DOM tree for the simple HTML file above.

<img src="images/simple-dom-tree.svg" alt="The DOM tree for a simple HTML file">

Notice that some tags, such as the \<p> paragraph tag,
are represented by multiple nodes.
The paragraph itself is an element node.
The text within the paragraph is a text node
(and in some cases, might be a subtree containing many nodes).
And the ID is an attribute node.

Except for the root node, each node in the tree has exactly one parent.
Each node can have many children.

An HTML file defines the initial structure of a document.
Dart or JavaScript can dynamically modify that document
by adding, deleting, and modifying the nodes in the DOM tree.
When the DOM is changed,
the browser immediately re-renders the window.

<img src="images/dynamic-dart.png"
     alt="A Dart program can dynamically change the DOM">

The diagram shows a small Dart program that makes
a modest change to the DOM by dynamically
changing a paragraph's text.
A program could add and delete nodes,
or even insert an entire sub-tree of nodes.

## Create a new Dart app {#create-dart-app}

In Dart Editor, create a new application called mini.
Unselect **Generate content for a basic web app**.
You will be building the files you need from scratch.
Make sure that **Add Pub support** is also unselected.

<img src="images/new-app-mini.png"
     alt="New Application dialog window">

Dart Editor creates a directory called mini and, within it,
a Dart source file named mini.dart
that contains the Dart code for a default command-line application.

<img src="images/new-app-files.png"
     alt="After new application created">

##Edit Dart source code {#dart-editor-happiness}

Use Dart Editor
to modify the source code
to look like this:

{% prettify dart %}
import 'dart:html';
void main() {
  query('#RipVanWinkle').text = 'Wake up, sleepy head!';
}
{% endprettify %}

<i class="icon-info-sign"> </i>
<a href="errors-warnings.html">What is Dart Editor trying to tell me?</a>

##About the Dart source code {#about-dart-code}

Let's step through the code.

###Importing libraries

The import directive imports the specified library,
making all of the classes and functions
in that library
available to your program.

<img src="images/0-mini-code-walk-through.png"
     alt="Import Dart HTML library">

This program imports Dart's HTML library,
which contains the classes and functions for programming the DOM.
Generally speaking, all Dart web apps need the Dart HTML library.
Key classes include:

| Dart class | Description |
|---|---|
| <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_html/Node.html" target="_blank">Node</a> | Implements a Dart Node. |
| <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_html/Element.html" target="_blank">Element</a> | A subclass of Node, implements a web page element. |
| <a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_html/Document.html" target="_blank">Document</a> | Another subclass of Node. Implements the document object. |
{: .table}

The Dart core library contains another useful class,
<a href="http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/List.html" target="_blank">List</a>,
a parameterized class that can specify the type of its members.
The Element class keeps its list of child Elements
in a List\<Element>, a list that can contain only Element objects.

###Using the query() function

This app's main() function contains a single
line of code that is a little like a run-on sentence
with multiple things happening one after another.
Let's deconstruct it.

query() is a top-level function provided by the Dart HTML library
that gets an Element object from the DOM.

<img src="images/3-mini-code-walk-through.png"
     alt="An example of querying for a DOM object by its ID">

The argument to query(), a string,
is a CSS selector that identifies the object.
Most commonly CSS selectors specify classes, identifiers, or attributes.
We'll look at these in a little more detail later,
when we add a CSS file to the mini app.
In this case RipVanWinkle is the unique ID for a paragraph element
declared in the HTML file
and #RipVanWinkle specifies that ID.

<img src="images/2-mini-code-walk-through.png"
     alt="ID attribute from HTML file">

Another useful function for getting elements from the DOM
is queryAll(),
which returns multiple Element objects via
a list of elements&mdash;List<Element>&mdash;all
of which match the provided selector.

###Setting the text of an Element

In the DOM, the text of a page element is contained
in a child node, specifically, a Text node.
In the following diagram,
the node containing the string
"RipVanWinkle paragraph."
is a text node.

<img src="images/paragraph-dom.png"
     alt="DOM tree for a paragraph element">

More complex text,
such as text with style changes or
embedded links and images,
would be represented with a subtree of text nodes and other objects.

In Dart,
you can simply use the Element `text` property,
which has a getter
that walks the subtree of nodes for you and extracts their text.

<img src="images/4-mini-code-walk-through.png"
     alt="Text node child of the paragraph">

However, if the text node has styles (and thus a subtree),
getting text and then setting it immediately is likely
to change the DOM, as a result of losing subtree information.

Often, as with our RipVanWinkle example,
this simplification has no adverse effects.
Do know, however, that with more complex situations
getting text and then setting it immediately
will likely change the text.

The assignment operator (=) sets the text
of the Element returned by the query() function
to the string "Wake up, sleepy head!".

<img src="images/5-mini-code-walk-through.png"
     alt="Set the text node, thereby changing the text on the page">

This causes the browser to immediately re-render
the browser page containing this app
dynamically displaying the text on the browser page.

## Create the HTML file {#create-html}

Now, let's create an HTML file to host the little app you just created.
In Dart Editor, select **File > New File**.
A dialog window appears.

<img src="images/new-html-file.png"
     alt="Create new HTML file">

<ol>
<li markdown="1">
Browse to the mini directory and select it.
</li>
<li markdown="1">
Type mini.html in the file name text box.
This follows convention: the basename is
the same as the application name
and it uses .html suffix.
</li>
<li markdown="1">
Click **Finish**.
</li>
</ol>

The Dart Editor auto-fills the file with some default HTML code.
There is more code than is necessary,
so replace the default contents with the following,
slightly simplified, HTML.

{% prettify html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
  <head>
    <title>A Minimalist App</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p id="RipVanWinkle"></p>
    <script type="application/dart" src="mini.dart"></script>
    <script src="http://dart.googlecode.com/svn/branches/bleeding_edge/dart/client/dart.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
{% endprettify %}

Finish your edits and save the file with **File > Save**.

##About the HTML source code {#about-html-code}

This HTML code is similar to the simple HTML code in the
various diagrams earlier in this target.
Again, you can see the use of the \<head>, \<title>, \<body>,
and \<p> tags.
And there, in the paragraph tag,
is the identifier "RipVanWinkle"
that the Dart code you created in the previous step uses
as an argument to query() to get the paragraph element.

New here is the use of the `script` tag.
A script's content is defined by a client-side script.
The HTML code above has two scripts.

<img src="images/script-tags.png"
     alt="Including Dart apps in HTML">

The first includes your mini app.
It uses two attributes: `type` indicates the type of the script.
`application/dart` is a new type created by the Dart team,
which is currently supported by Dartium.
The `src` attribute provides the URL to the source file of the script.
In this case, it is the Dart source file `mini.dart` that you created earlier.
The Dart file should be in the same directory as its host HTML file.

The second `script` tag is
a bootstrap script that takes care of turning on the Dart VM,
as well as compatibility with non-Dart browsers.

This diagram summarizes the connection
between `mini.dart` and `mini.html`.

<img src="images/dart-html-connect.png"
     alt="The connection between the HTML file and the Dart file">

## Run the mini web app {#run-mini}

In Dart Editor,
make sure that one of `mini`'s files or the directory is selected,
and then click the Run button
<img src="images/run.png" width="16" height="16"
     alt="Run button">.

Dart Editor invokes Dartium
and loads `mini.html` in it.

<img src="images/mini-output.png"
     alt="Mini app running in Dartium">

The Dart web app changed
the text in the browser window dynamically at runtime.
Of course, placing static text on a browser page
and doing nothing else
could be accomplished with straight HTML.
This little app only shows you how to make a connection
from a Dart app to a browser page.

##Create a JavaScript launch {#mini-with-js}

You can create various runtime scenarios for your Dart app
using *launches* in Dart Editor.
A launch specifies a runtime configuration,
such as whether to compile to JavaScript
or what browser to use.

In this section,
you will create a launch for mini that first compiles the app to
JavaScript and then runs it in the default system browser.

<ol>
<li markdown="1">
In Dart Editor,
click the wee arrow to the right of the run button
<img src="images/run.png" width="16" height="16"
     alt="Run button">.
A menu appears:

<img src="images/manage-launches-menu.png"
     alt="Manage launches menu">

You have been unwittingly using launches when running
the samples so far.
The menu item mini.html is a launch that Dart Editor
automatically created
when you ran the application for the first time
in the previous section.
</li>

<li markdown="1">
Select **Manage launches** from the menu
to bring up the **Manage Launches** dialog.
</li>

<li markdown="1">
Now, click the new launch button
<img src="images/new-launch-button.png" width="28" height="22"
     alt="New launch button">.
A menu appears that gives you three options:

<img src="images/new-launch-menu.png"
     alt="New launch menu with three options">

A command-line launch runs in Dart Editor in
the **Output view**.
If your app is a command-line app (a `.dart` file with no `.html` file)
Dart Editor automatically creates a command-line launch
with the name of the `.dart` file that contains the main() function.

A Dartium launch runs in a Chromium window invoked by Dart Editor.
If your app is a web app,
Dart Editor automatically creates a Dartium launch
with the name of the `.html` file that includes the Dart app.

You must explicitly create a Dart JavaScript launch
to create a runtime configuration that compiles
your web app to JavaScript and then runs it in a browser.
</li>

<li markdown="1">
Select **Dart JavaScript launch**.
The dialog window adjusts to present the appropriate options
for your selection.
</li>

<li markdown="1">
Name the launch by typing `mini-with-js` in the first text box.

<img src="images/new-js-launch.png"
     alt="Create a launch that compiles to JavaScript">

It is recommended that the launch name reflect
the important aspects of its configuration.
In this case, the launch name specifies the app name
and that it's a JavaScript launch.
If the launch specified a browser, such as FireFox,
you might name the launch `mini-with-js-in-firefox`.
</li>

<li markdown="1">
The launch target is the HTML file `mini.html`.
Browse to the file.
</li>

<li markdown="1">
Click **Apply**.
The named launch should now appear
in the list to the left of the window.

<img src="images/mini-with-js-item.png"
     alt="New named launch in the list of launches">

</li>

<li markdown="1">
To run the launch,
click the Run button at the bottom right of the window.
Or select it from the Run menu on the main Dart Editor window.

This time, Dart Editor
creates a JavaScript file,
invokes the default system browser
and loads the JavaScript file into it.
The output should look the same.
</li>

</ol>

##Create a CSS file {#add-css}

Most HTML uses cascading style sheets to define _styles_
that control the appearance of page elements.
Let's create a simple CSS file for the mini app.

In Dart Editor, create a file named mini.css
in the mini directory with the following text:

{% prettify dart %}
#RipVanWinkle {
  font-size: 20px;
  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
  margin-top: 20px;
  background-color: SlateBlue;
  color: Yellow;  
}
{% endprettify %}

This defines a style
for the page element
with the ID RipVanWinkle.
To use this style sheet,
edit mini.html and add the line shown in bold below:

<img src="images/html-with-css.png"
     alt="HTML with CSS">

Save your files and run the app again.

<img src="images/mini-output-with-css.png"
     alt="Mini app running in Dartium with CSS styles in effect">

##About CSS selectors {#about-css-selectors}

IDs, classes, and other information about elements
are established in HTML.
Your Dart code can use this information
to get elements using a CSS selector&mdash;a pattern
used to select matching elements in the DOM.
CSS selectors allow the CSS, HTML, and Dart code
to refer to the same objects.
Commonly, a selector specifies an ID,
an HTML element type,
a class, or an attribute.
Selectors can also be nested.

CSS selectors are important in Dart programs
because you use them with query() and queryAll()
to get matching elements from the DOM.
Most often Dart programs use ID selectors with query()
and class selectors with queryAll().

Here are some examples of CSS selectors:

| Selector type | Example | Description |
|---|---|
| ID selector | #RipVanWinkle | Matches a single, unique element |
| HTML element | p | Matches all paragraphs |
| HTML element | h1 | Matches all level-one headers |
| Class | _.classname_ | Matches all items with the class _classname_  |
| Asterisk | * | Using the asterisk matches all elements |
| Attribute | input[type="button"] | Matches all button input elements |
{: .table}

<aside class="alert">
  <strong>Tip:</strong>
As you saw,
mini app used a CSS selector,
the ID #RipVanWinkle,
even when there was no CSS file.
You do not need a CSS file for a Dart program.
Nor do you need a CSS file to use CSS selectors.
CSS selectors are established in the HTML file
and used by the Dart program 
to select matching elements.
</aside>

Let's look at the CSS code for mini app.
The CSS file for the mini app has one CSS rule in it.
A CSS rule has two main parts: a selector and a set of declarations.

<img src="images/css-rule-explained.png"
     alt="The parts of a CSS rule">

In mini app, the selector #RipVanWinkle is an ID selector,
as signaled by the hash tag (#);
it matches a single, unique element with the specified ID,
our now tired RipVanWinkle paragraph element.
RipVanWinkle is the ID in the HTML file.
It is referred to in the CSS file and in the Dart code
using a hash tag(#).
Classnames are specified in the HTML file without a period (.)
and referred to in the CSS file and in Dart code with a period (.).

Between the curly brackets of a CSS rule is
a list of declarations,
each of which ends in a semi-colon (;).
Each declaration specifies a property and its value.
Together the set of declarations define the _style sheet_
for all matching elements.
The style sheet is used to set the appearance
of the matching element(s) on the web page.

<img src="images/css-property-value.png"
     alt="A declaration specifies an attribute and its value">

The CSS rule for the RipVanWinkle paragraph
specifies several properties;
for example, it sets the text color to Yellow.
