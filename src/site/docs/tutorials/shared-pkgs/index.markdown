Now that you're able to create and run a Dart application
and have a basic understanding of DOM programming,
you are ready to leverage code written by other programmers.
Many interesting and useful packages of reusable Dart code
are available at the
<a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/">pub.dartlang.org</a>
repository.

This tutorial shows you how to use `pub`&mdash;a package manager
that comes with Dart&mdash;to
install one of the packages in the repository,
the vector_math package.
You can follow these same steps to install any package hosted at
<a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/">pub.dartlang.org</a>;
just change the package name when you get to that step.
This tutorial also describes some of the resources you can expect to find
in a well-built package.

##About the pubspec.yaml file {#about-pubspec}

To use an external package,
your application must itself be a package.
Any application with a valid pubspec.yaml file in its top-level directory
is a package and can therefore use external packages.
When you create an application using Dart Editor,
Dart Editor automatically creates a `pubspec.yaml` file.

Start Dart Editor and create a new application with the name `vector_victor`.
Double click pubspec.yaml to view its contents.

<img class="scale-img-max" src="images/victor-files.png"
     alt="Dart Editor with pubspec.yaml file">

The pubspec.yaml file contains the package specification written in YAML
(visit <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/doc/pubspec.html">Pubspec Format</a>
for in-depth coverage).
Dart Editor provides a user interface for editing the pubspec.yaml file
so that you don't have to worry about the YAML format.
Or you can click the **Source** tab at the bottom of the Editor pane
to edit the YAML code directly.
Below is the pubspec.yaml file that was
created for the vector_victor application.

<img class="scale-img-max" src="images/pubspec.png"
     alt="The default pubspec.yaml file specifies name and description">

The package name is required.
You'll note that the pubspec.yaml file already
lists a dependency on the browser package.
Web applications that don't use polymer.dart
need the browser package.

##...Or put an existing application into a package {#old-app-in-pkg}

If you already have an application
and want it to use an external package,
simply create a pubspec.yaml file in the application's top-level directory.
Your pubspec.yaml file must at least specify the package name.

<img class="scale-img-max" src="images/minimalpubspec.png"
     alt="The smallest possible pubspec.yaml">

<aside class="alert">
<strong>Tip:</strong> If you are using
Dart Editor to create the pubspec.yaml file,
you might get an error message
when you first create the empty pubspec.yaml file.
This is because Dart Editor runs pub automatically and
is trying to resolve the package specification file,
which at first has nothing in it.
Ignore the message,
add the required name field,
and save the pubspec.yaml file.
</aside>

##Name the package dependencies {#name-dependencies}

To use an external library package,
you need to add the package to your
application's list of _dependencies_
in the pubspec.yaml file.
Each item in the dependencies list
specifies the name, and sometimes the version,
of a package that your application uses.

Let's make the vector_victor application have a dependency 
on the vector_math package,
which is available at pub.dartlang.org.

* Click the **Add** button in Dart Editor.

<img class="scale-img-max" src="images/dependencies-ui.png"
     alt="Click the add button to add a package dependency">

* Enter the name of the package in the popup window.

<img class="scale-img-max" src="images/add-dependency-window.png"
     alt="Enter the package name">

Dart Editor adds the package name to the list.

<img class="scale-img-max" src="images/after-add.png"
     alt="The application is now dependent on vector_math">

Notice the **Version** field.
`any` means that this application can use
any version of the vector_math package.
You could instead specify a particular version of the package.
When versioning becomes important to your project,
check out
<a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/doc/versioning.html">
Pub's Versioning Philosophy
</a>.

Here's the new pubspec.yaml file:

<img class="scale-img-max" src="images/pubspec-vectormath.png"
     alt="Pubspec.yaml file with vector_math dependency">

<a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/">pub.dartlang.org</a>
is the primary public repository for Dart packages.
`pub` automatically checks that
website when resolving package dependencies.
To use one of the packages from that site,
you can specify it by its simple name,
as we have done here.

##Install the package dependencies {#install-dependencies}

In Dart Editor, save pubspec.yaml with **File > Save**.
When you save the file,
Dart Editor automatically runs
<a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/doc/pub-install.html">pub get</a>,
which recursively installs the Dart libraries
from the packages in the dependencies list.
You can also select **Pub Install** from the **Tools** menu in Dart Editor.

Pub puts the libraries in a directory called packages
under the application's top-level directory.
Click the wee arrow to expand the packages directory.
There you will find the vector_math directory,
which links to the Dart libraries from the vector_math package.

<img class="scale-img-max" src="images/run-pub-install.png"
     alt="Pub Install finds and installs required packages">

Pub install works recursively;
if the included package has dependencies, those packages are installed as well.

Pub install creates a file called pubspec.lock,
which identifies the specific versions of the packages that were installed.
This helps to provide a stable development environment.
Later you can modify the version constraints and use `pub update`
to update to new versions as needed.

##What did you get (and not get)? {#about-packages}

Besides the Dart libraries,
the vector_math package has other resources that might be useful to you
that do not get installed into your application directory.
Let's take a step back for a moment to look at what
you got and where it came from.

To see the contents of the vector_math package,
visit the
<a href="https://github.com/johnmccutchan/vector_math" target="_blank">
Dart vector math repository
</a>
at github.
Although many files and directories are in the repository,
only one, `lib`, was installed when you ran pub get.

         alt="Dart libraries directory"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-7">
      <em>Dart libraries</em>:
      The lib directory contains one or more Dart libraries,
      which can be imported into your Dart programs.

    </div>
    <div class="col-md-7">
      <em>Housekeeping files</em>:
      When using a package written by someone else,
      the README file is a good place to start.
      It should contain important information about the package,
      such as its intent, contents, samples, and instructions.
      The LICENSE file provides copyright and rules-of-use information.
      These files can be found at the package repository.
      They are not installed when you install a package.

      <em>Other resources</em>:

      a package might also contain other resources 
      such as example code, tests, scripts, and documentation.
      If a package contains these resources,
      they should be in the directories as specified in the pub
<a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/doc/package-layout.html">conventions</a>.
    </div>
  </div>

##Import libraries from a package {#use-package}

Open the vector_math directory by clicking the little arrow.

<img class="scale-img-max" src="images/the-vectormath-library.png"
     alt="Finally, the vector_math library files">

The directory contains a Dart file called vector_math.dart,
which you import into your Dart application,
and a `src` directory,
which contains the source code for the library.
As with the SDK libraries,
use the import directive to use code from an installed library.
The Dart SDK libraries are built-in and
are identified with the special dart: prefix.
For external libraries installed by pub,
use the `package:` prefix.

{% prettify dart %}
import 'package:vector_math/vector_math.dart';
{% endprettify %}

Note that you specify the filename, not the library name.

##Other resources

<ul>
  <li>
    Dart developers share packages at
    <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/">pub.dartlang.org</a>.
    Look there for packages that might be useful to you,
    or share your own Dart packages.
    See the <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/doc/">pub documentation</a>
    to get started using and sharing packages.
  </li>
</ul>

##What next? {#what-next}

One package at pub.dartlang.org is polymer.dart,
which makes writing web applications easier
with data binding, templates, and declarative event handlers.
Check out the next tutorial,
[Define a Custom Element](/docs/tutorials/polymer-intro),
for an introduction to polymer.dart.
