<h3>Save data on the client.</h3>
</div>

Browsers provide several ways for your apps to store data on the client side.
One storage option is IndexedDB&mdash;a
web standard supported by
<a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=indexeddb"
   target="_blank">many browsers</a>.
IndexedDB provides an implementation of an indexed database,
in which each record is identified by a unique index or key,
making data retrieval speedy.
You can store large amounts of structured data,
such as images, arrays, maps, and objects using IndexedDB.
The standard does not specify size limits for
individual data items or for the database itself,
but browsers may impose storage limits.

IndexedDB provides several advantages.
Your apps

* can have full functionality even if a network connection is not available.
* can cache data and restore state between invocations.
* won't lose data if the network connection is interrupted.
* generate less network traffic.
* perform better because data management happens on the local computer
rather than over the Internet.

<aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
<strong>Note:</strong>
Some browsers don't yet support IndexedDB.
Check
<a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=indexeddb"
   target="_blank">caniuse.com</a>
for up-to-date information.
Your app can check programmatically
if the current platform supports IndexedDB
and adjust accordingly.

##Run the app {#run-the-app}

The `count_down` app below maintains a list of milestones
and displays a countdown timer for each one.

**Try it!**
Enter the name, date, and time of a milestone&mdash;your
birthday, for example&mdash;and click the plus (**+**) button.
The app starts a countdown timer
and displays the amount of time remaining until the milestone occurs.
The app updates the display every second.

Close this browser window and reload
<a href="index.html#run-the-app">this page</a>.
The milestone you created still exists
because the app stored it in an IndexedDB in the browser.

Use the minus (**-**) button to the right of a milestone
to delete that milestone.
Use the **Clear** button to delete all the milestones.

###Using developer tools to look at the database

You can use the browser's developer tools
to explore the IndexedDB databases used by your apps.
In Chrome, select **View&nbsp;>&nbsp;Developer&nbsp;>&nbsp;Developer Tools**,
then choose **Resources** from the tabs along the top of the window.
The following diagram shows the database
for the count_down app with two milestones.

The count_down app has a single database named `milestoneDB`.
and within it, a single object store named `milestoneStore`.
In this example, each record in the object store
is a milestone stored as a Map.
The index, called `name_index`, associates each milestone
name with a database key allowing for searches by milestone name.

![Using Dev Tools to view indexed databases](images/devtools-intro.png)

##About the app: The basics {#the-basics}

The count_down app uses a Model, View, View-model (MVVM) structure.

![Structure of the count_down app](images/MVVM-simple.png)

* The **View-model**, in the center of the diagram,
connects the View and the Model,
using UI and Timer events
to make changes to the Model.
The MilestoneApp class is the primary class
that implements the View-Model&mdash;it
manages the timer,
and implements the app's business logic,
which manages the information exchange between the Model and the View.

* The **View** provides the user interface for the app.
Two custom elements implement the View in the count_down app:
CountDownComponent describes the user interface for the app as a whole,
and MilestoneComponent describes the UI for an individual milestone.
These components inform the View-model of UI events.

* The **Model** contains and manages the data.
The Model,
implemented by the MilestoneStore class,
manages a list of Milestone objects in memory
and keeps an IndexedDB in sync with the list,
saving the milestone data persistently.
The View-model queries the Model upon initialization
and uses Polymer data-bindings to keep the View in sync.
Also, it uses Timer events to trigger updates in the Model.

###The libraries used by the count_down app 

The count_down app uses the following libraries:

##Details about IndexedDB

Some important facts you need to know about IndexedDB:

* Each origin (host, protocol, and port) has its own set of databases.
A unique name identifies each database within an origin.
IndexedDB has a same-origin policy,
which requires that the database and the app be from the same origin.

* A _database_ is identified by a name and version number.
A database can have only one version at a time.

* An _object store_ is identified by a unique name.
You can create an object store only during an "upgrade needed" event.
You store data in records in an object store.
A database can have multiple named object stores.

* A _transaction_ provides reliable data access
and data modification on a database.
All interactions with the data in the database must happen within
the scope of a transaction.

* A _record_ is a key-value pair,
where the key is a unique identifier for the corresponding data value.
You can set your own keys
or you can have the object store create them for you.

* An _index_ is a specialized object store that
maps database keys to the key field in the saved object.
Using an index is optional.

* An app may use multiple databases,
each of which may have multiple object stores,
each of which may have multiple records.

![Indexed Databases in general](images/generaldatabase.png) 

###IndexedDB in the count_down app

The count_down app uses one database,
named `milestoneDB` with the version number `1`,
and one object store named `milestoneStore`.
The app stores a milestone object as a Map;
both the key and the value in the map are strings.
The `milestoneName` field is the unique name of the milestone.
The `happensOn` field is the date and time concatenated together.
This is enough information to restore the state of the app
when it's restarted.

![Indexed Database in the count_down app](images/database.png) 

Because the milestone names are unique,
the app could use them as primary keys in the database.
Instead, for illustration purposes,
the app uses a primary key generated by the database.
You can see this in the Developer Tools window:

![Milestone objects in the object store](images/devtools-details.png)

##Importing the IndexedDB library {#import-indexeddb}

To use the Dart IndexedDB API,
your app must import the IndexedDB library
provided with the Dart SDK:

{% prettify dart %}
import 'dart:indexed_db';
{% endprettify %}

##Checking for IndexedDB support {#checking-indexeddb}

Use the getter `supported` from the IdbFactory class
to determine if IndexedDB is supported.

{% prettify dart %}
bool idbAvailable = IdbFactory.supported;
{% endprettify %}

If `supported` is false, your app could

* throw an exception and quit,
* use an alternative API,
such as `window.localStorage`,
for client-side storage,
* run anyway, sacrificing persistence and offline capability,
* or, like the count_down app, disable the UI and display an error message.

##Creating and opening a database {#opening-indexeddb}

Use `window.indexedDB.open()` to create a new database
or to open an existing database.
Whether it opens or creates the database
depends on the name and version number you pass in as parameters.

* To open a database,
use the name and current version number
of an existing database.

* To update to a new version,
call open() with the name of an existing database
and a higher version number.
(A database can have only one version at a time;
it can't exist in multiple versions at once.)
This fires an upgrade needed event.

* To create a completely new database,
open it with a new, unique name.
This also fires an upgrade needed event.

Here's the function in the MilestoneStore class
that creates and opens the database:

{% prettify dart %}
Future open() {
  return window.indexedDB.open('milestoneDB',
      version: 1,
      onUpgradeNeeded: _initializeDatabase)
    .then(_loadFromDB);
}
{% endprettify %}

The first two parameters indicate the name and version of the
database to open.
The first time the count_down app runs from a particular origin,
`milestoneDB` version 1 gets created and opened.
The next time the app runs from that same origin,
the database is simply opened.

The third parameter, `onUpgradeNeeded`,
provides a callback function that gets called
when an upgrade needed event is fired,
which happens when a new database is created
or the version of a database is updated.
This gives your app an opportunity to create an object store.
The only place you can create an object store
is within an upgrade needed event.
You _must_ have an object store to add records to the database.
The next section covers how to create an object store.

The following flow chart describes the logic of the
`window.indexedDB.open()` function.

![Logic flow of database creation](images/flowchart.png)

Because creating and opening a database can take time,
`window.indexedDB.open()` returns a Future object,
which runs asynchronously and returns a value, the database object,
sometime in the future.
The database object is returned to a callback function
registered with `then()`.
In this example,
the callback function is called `_loadFromDB()`.
Using cursors,
`_loadFromDB()` reads all the milestones 
from the database and populates the app.
The details are covered in
[Using a cursor to get all the records](#getting-data).

##Creating an object store {#creating-object-store}

When a new database
is created,
it contains no object stores.
The only place you can create an object store
is during an upgrade needed event.
Fortunately, an upgrade needed event is
fired when a new database
(or a new version of a database)
is created.

The callback function for upgrade needed events
in the count_down app is `_initializeDatabase`.
This function creates an object store and an index.

{% prettify dart %}
static const String MILESTONE_STORE = 'milestoneStore';
static const String NAME_INDEX = 'name_index';

void _initializeDatabase(VersionChangeEvent e) {
  Database db = (e.target as Request).result;
  
  var objectStore = db.createObjectStore(MILESTONE_STORE,
      autoIncrement: true);
  var index = objectStore.createIndex(NAME_INDEX, 'milestoneName',
      unique: true);
}
{% endprettify %}

The code gets the database object from the
VersionChangeEvent object that is passed into the
callback function as an argument.

Use the Database object's `createObjectStore()` method
to create a new object store with the given name.
Each object store must have a unique name.
The count_down app uses one object store called `milestoneStore`.
All the countdown milestones are stored and retrieved
in this object store.

The code sets `autoIncrement` on the object store to true.
When autoIncrement is true,
the database generates unique, primary keys for you,
which saves you the trouble of ensuring unique keys.

Finally, `_initializeDatabase` creates a name index.

##Using a name index

An index provides a lookup table.
You can associate a primary key with a field in the stored objects.
In the example,
the index associates a primary key with the milestoneName field.

![Use an index to allow for searches on a field in the objects](images/devtools-with-index.png)

Using an index provides two benefits:

* you can search on a field in the object instead of by primary key,
* and you can use the index to ensure the value of the field is unique.

The count_down app creates an index at the same
time it creates the object store:
during an upgrade needed event,
which is the
the only time you can create an index.

{% prettify dart %}
static const String NAME_INDEX = 'name_index';
...
objectStore.createIndex(NAME_INDEX, 'milestoneName', unique: true);
{% endprettify %}

The createIndex method takes three parameters:

* the name of the index, here 'name_index'. This must be unique.
* the _key path_, which indicates the field in the stored object to index.
* unique, a boolean value.
When true, the index ensures that the milestone name is unique.
In the count_down app,
if you try to add a milestone with the same name as another,
it is this index that causes the add() to fail.

##Using transactions {#using-transactions}

All database operations must be performed
within a
<a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_indexedDb/Transaction.html" target="_blank">Transaction</a>.

<aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
<strong>Important: About the life-cycle of a transaction</strong>

The life-cycle of a transaction is as follows:

* Open a transaction.
* Place requests on the transaction and register callbacks.
* When there are no more requests
and the last callback finishes, the transaction completes.

So, a transaction remains alive until all requests are complete and
the final callback completes.
You can keep a transaction alive by placing a new request
within a callback.

<strong>A good rule:</strong>
During the scope of a transaction,
perform only database-related tasks
to avoid crazy, mind-boggling bugs related to the DOM event loop.

</aside>

Get a transaction from the Database object,
which in the count_app is named `_db`.

{% prettify dart %}
Transaction t = _db.transaction(storeNameOrNames, mode);
{% endprettify %}

The first argument to `transaction()` is the scope of the transaction.
In the count_down app,
the scope is always `milestoneStore`,
the lone object store in the database,
but you could specify multiple object stores.
For efficiency, you should specify only the stores you need.

The second argument is a string that specifies the mode;
it can be `readwrite` or `readonly` or `versionchange`.
The count_down app uses only readwrite and readonly transactions.
Use readwrite transactions only when necessary:
readonly transactions are more efficient,
and you can run multiple readonly transactions
concurrently on overlapping scopes,
but only one readwrite transaction.

Once you've created a transaction,
you can perform one or more operations
using that transaction.
Database operations can take time,
so the work is performed off of the main UI thread and
results are provided via Futures.
Each operation uses a Future,
which completes when the operation is complete.
The transaction itself also uses a Future,
which completes when all operations on the transaction complete.

For example,
you might use one transaction to add multiple records to an object store.
Each add is a separate operation and uses a separate Future.
The following diagram shows the logic flow
of a program that adds three records to a database.
When all three add operations complete,
the transaction completes.

![Transactions, object store operations, and futures](images/futures-flow.png)

Many database transactions follow this pattern:

* Create a transaction on an object store.
* Perform one or more operations using the transaction.
* Use the operation's callback function
to perform a task when the operation completes successfully.
For example, when adding records to a database,
you can get the key generated by the database for the added record.
* Use the `transaction.completed` callback function
to perform a task when all the operations complete successfully.
Generally, the count_down app uses this callback function
to keep the list of milestones in sync with the database.

##Adding data

Here's the code that adds a new record to the database.

![Adding a record to an IndexedDB](images/add-operation.png)

The code creates a new Milestone object and converts it to a Map,
then creates a new readwrite Transaction on the object store.

Then, to add the milestone Map to the database,
the code calls the `add()` method on the object store.
and registers a callback function using `then()`.
Because the object store was created with `autoIncrement: true`,
adding a record to the database automatically creates
a unique primary key for the new record.
This key is returned as a parameter to the callback function.

Finally, the code registers a callback function
for the transaction.

When the add operation has been performed on the database,
the Future related to the add operation completes
and the callback function is called with the auto-generated key.
The count_down app saves the key in the Milestone object.

At this point,
it is important to note that although the add operation is complete,
the transaction is not!
Any changes made to the database by the operation
are not available until the transaction completes.

When all operations on a transaction complete,
in this case, a single add operation,
the transaction completes and its callback function is called.
In the transaction’s callback function,
the count_down app adds the milestone to the list in memory
and the Future returns with the new milestone object
(and the View-model starts the Timer).

##Removing data

Here's the code that removes a key-value pair from a database.

{% prettify dart %}
var transaction = _db.transaction(MILESTONE_STORE, 'readwrite');
transaction.objectStore(MILESTONE_STORE).delete(milestone.dbKey);

return transaction.completed.then((_) {
  milestone.dbKey = null;
  milestones.remove(milestone);
});
{% endprettify %}

Again the code creates a readwrite transaction on a named object store.
To delete a key-value pair, the mode must be readwrite.
Use the `delete()` method on the object store to delete a key-value pair.
Specify the key as the argument to delete().

When the transaction completes successfully,
the count_down app can safely remove the milestone from the list in
local memory and stop the timer, if necessary.

Note that this code
does not specify a callback function for the delete operation,
only for the transaction.
The task it needs to do,
namely to remove the milestone from the list in memory,
can occur when the transaction completes.

##Clearing all data

Use the `clear` method on the object store to remove all records.

{% prettify dart %}
var transaction = _db.transaction(MILESTONE_STORE, 'readwrite');
transaction.objectStore(MILESTONE_STORE).clear();

return transaction.completed.then((_) {
  milestones.clear();
});
{% endprettify %}

##Using a cursor to get all the records {#getting-data}

When the app starts,
if there's an existing database
and that database has milestones,
the count_down app reads
the records from the database
and initializes the internal list of milestones
from that information.

The `_loadFromDB()` method
gets called after the database has been successfully opened.
It is within this method that the database is read.

{% prettify dart %}
Future _loadFromDB(Database db) {
  _db = db;

  var trans = db.transaction(MILESTONE_STORE, 'readonly');
  var store = trans.objectStore(MILESTONE_STORE);

  var cursors = store.openCursor(autoAdvance: true).asBroadcastStream();
  cursors.listen((cursor) {
    var milestone = new Milestone.fromRaw(cursor.key, cursor.value);
    milestones.add(milestone);
  });

  return cursors.length.then((_) {
    return milestones.length;
  });
}
{% endprettify %}

Because getting records does not modify the database,
this transaction is readonly.

You can use a
<a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_indexedDb/Cursor.html" target="_blank">Cursor</a>
object to step through the records in the database one by one,
creating a Milestone object for each.
The object store uses a stream to fire an event for each record
retrieved from the database.
By listening on the stream,
your code can be notified for each record read.
The count_down app creates a corresponding Milestone object
in the internal list in memory for each database record retrieved.

Open a cursor on a transaction's object store with `openCursor`.
The cursor indicates the current position in the database.
The count_down app opens a cursor and sets the optional
`autoAdvance` argument to true.
This means that after reading a record from the database
and returning its value,
the cursor advances automatically to the next record.
If you don't use autoAdvance, 
your code has to use the `next()` method
to advance the cursor to the next record.

![Advance the cursor with autoAdvance or cursor.next](images/cursoradvance.png)

The openCursor() method returns a stream on which you can listen for events.
Here,
the stream is a broadcast stream,
so the app can listen both for read events
and for a final count of records retrieved.

For each record retrieved from the database,
an event fires and the callback function is called.
A
<a href="https://api.dartlang.org/dart_indexedDb/CursorWithValue.html" target="_blank">CursorWithValue</a>
object, named `cursor` in this example,
is passed to the callback function.
Use `cursor.key` to get the key for the record just retrieved.
Use `cursor.value` to get the value for that record.

The _loadFromDB method returns a Future that returns the length of the stream.
