<p>Welcome to Dart, an open-source, batteries-included developer platform
  for building structured HTML5 web apps. This chapter tells you why Google
  created Dart, what’s cool about Dart, and how to write and run your first
  Dart app.</p><p>Dart provides not only a new language, but libraries, an editor, a
  virtual machine (VM), a browser that can run Dart apps natively, and a
  compiler to JavaScript. Dart aims to be a more productive way to build the
  high-performance, modern apps that users demand.</p><div class="warning" title="Warning"><h4 class="title">Warning</h4><p>Dart is still changing! This book reflects the Milestone 1 release
    (October 2012), which aims to finalize the language but not the libraries.
    Wherever possible, this book tells you what we expect to change.</p></div>

    <div class="sect1" title="Why Google created Dart"><h2 id="ch01-why-dart"/>Why Google created Dart</h2><p>Google cares a lot about helping to make the web great. We write a
    lot of web apps, many of them quite sophisticated—think Gmail, Google
    Calendar, Google+, and more. We want web apps to load quickly, run
    smoothly, and present engaging and fun experiences to users. We want
    developers of all backgrounds to be able to build great experiences for
    the browser.</p><p>As an example of Google’s commitment to the web, consider the Google
    Chrome browser. Google created it to spur competition at a time when the
    web platform seemed to be stagnating. It worked. As <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#BrowserChart" title="Figure 1-1. Browser speed">Figure 1-1</a> shows, browser speed has increased immensely
    since Chrome’s introduction in 2008.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h4 class="title">Note</h4><p>The JavaScript engine known as <em class="firstterm">V8</em> is
      responsible for much of Chrome’s speed. Many of the V8 engineers are now
      working on the Dart project.</p></div><div class="figure"id="BrowserChart"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figs/web/daur_0101.png" alt="Browser speed"/></div></div><p class="title">Figure 1-1. Browser speed</p></div><p>
      
    </p><p>The number of new features in browsers has also increased, with APIs
    such as WebGL, FileSystem, Web workers, and WebSockets. Browsers now have
    automatic update capabilities, frequently delivering new features and
    fixes directly to the user. Mobile devices such as tablets and phones also
    have modern browsers with many HTML5 features.</p><p>Despite these improvements in the web platform, the developer
    experience hasn’t improved as much as we’d like. We believe it should be
    easier to build larger, more complex web apps. It’s taken far too long for
    productive tools to emerge, and they still don’t match the capabilities
    offered by other developer platforms. You shouldn’t have to be intimately
    familiar with web programming to start building awesome apps for the
    modern web. And even though JavaScript engines are getting faster, web
    apps still start up much too slowly.</p><p>We hope that Dart helps developers from many different backgrounds
    build more awesome apps for the modern web.</p><p>We expect Dart to help in two main ways:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Better performance:</em></span> As VM engineers, the
        designers of Dart know how to build a language for performance. A more
        structured language is easier to optimize, and a fresh VM enables
        improvements such as faster startup.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Better productivity:</em></span> Support for
        libraries and packages helps you work with other developers and easily
        reuse code from other projects. Types can make APIs clearer and easier
        to use. Tools help you refactor, navigate, and debug code.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect1" title="A quick look at the Dart language"><h2 id="id393795"/>A quick look at the Dart language</h2><p>It’s hard to talk about a language without seeing it. Here’s a peek
    at a small Dart program:</p><pre class="programlisting">import 'dart:math';

class Point {
  num x, y;
  Point(this.x, this.y);
  num distanceTo(Point other) {
    var dx = x - other.x;
    var dy = y - other.y;
    return sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
  }
}

main() {
  var p = new Point(2, 3);
  var q = new Point(3, 4);
  print('distance from p to q = ${p.distanceTo(q)}');
}</pre><p>Of course, Dart’s main use case is building modern web apps.
    Programming the browser is easy:</p><pre class="programlisting">import 'dart:html';

main() {
  var button = new ButtonElement();
  button..id = 'confirm'
        ..text = 'Click to Confirm'
        ..classes.add('important')
        ..on.click.add((e) =&gt; window.alert('Confirmed!'));
  query('#registration').elements.add(button);
}</pre><p>You’ll learn about the Dart language and libraries in Chapters 2 and
    3, respectively.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="What’s cool about Dart"><h2 id="ch01-whats-cool"/>What’s cool about Dart</h2><p>Dart may look familiar, but don’t let that fool you. Dart has lots
    of cool features to help give you a productive and fun experience building
    the next generation of awesome web apps.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Dart is easy to learn.</em></span> A wide range of
    developers can learn Dart quickly. It’s an object-oriented language with
    classes, single inheritance, lexical scope, top-level functions, and a
    familiar syntax. Most developers are up and running with Dart in just a
    few hours.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Dart compiles to JavaScript.</em></span> Dart has been
    designed from the start to compile to JavaScript, so that Dart apps can
    run across the entire modern web. Every feature considered for the
    language must somehow be translated to performant and logical JavaScript
    before it is added. Dart draws a line in the sand and doesn’t support
    older, legacy browsers.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Dart runs in the client and on the server.</em></span> The
    Dart virtual machine (VM) can be integrated into a web browser, but it can
    also run standalone on the command line. With built-in library support for
    files, directories, sockets, and even web servers, you can use Dart for
    full end-to-end apps.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Dart comes with a lightweight editor.</em></span> You can
    use Dart Editor to write, launch, and debug Dart apps. The editor can help
    you with code completion, detecting potential bugs, debugging both
    command-line and web apps, and even refactoring. Dart Editor isn’t
    required for writing Dart; it’s just a tool that can help you write better
    code faster.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Dart supports types, without requiring them.</em></span>
    You can omit types when you want to move very quickly, aren’t sure what
    structure to take, or simply want to express something you can’t with the
    type system. You can add types as your program matures, the structure
    becomes more evident, and more developers join the project. Dart’s
    optional types are static type annotations that act as documentation,
    clearly expressing your intent. Using types means that fewer comments are
    required to document the code, and tools can give better warnings and
    error messages.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Dart scales from small scripts to large, complex
    apps.</em></span> Web development is very much an iterative process. With
    the reload button acting as your compiler, building the seed of a web app
    is often a fun experience of writing a few functions just to experiment.
    As the idea grows, you can add more code and structure. Thanks to Dart’s
    support for top-level functions, optional types, classes, and libraries,
    your Dart programs can start small and grow over time. Tools such as Dart
    Editor help you refactor and navigate your code as it evolves.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Dart has a wide array of built-in libraries.</em></span>
    The core library supports built-in types and other fundamental features
    such as collections, dates, and regular expressions. Web apps can use the
    HTML library—think DOM programming, but optimized for Dart. Command-line
    apps can use the I/O library to work with files, directories, sockets, and
    servers. Other libraries include URI, UTF, Crypto, Math, Unit test.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Dart supports safe, simple concurrency with
    isolates.</em></span> Traditional shared-memory threads are difficult to
    debug and can lead to deadlocks. Dart’s isolates, inspired by Erlang,
    provide an easier to understand model for running isolated, but
    concurrent, portions of your code. Spawning new isolates is cheap and
    fast, and no state is shared. In web apps, isolates even compile to Web
    workers.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Dart supports code sharing.</em></span> Traditional web
    programming workflows can’t integrate third-party libraries from arbitrary
    sources or frameworks. With the Dart package manager (pub) and language
    features such as libraries, you can easily discover, install, and
    integrate code from across the web and enterprise.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Dart is open source.</em></span> Dart was born for the web,
    and it’s available under a BSD-style license. You can find the project’s
    issue tracker and source repository at <a class="ulink" href="http://dart.googlecode.com">dart.googlecode.com</a>. Maybe you’ll
    submit the next patch?</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Up and running"><h2 id="ch01-editor"/>Up and running</h2><p>Now that you know something about Dart, get ready to code! These
    instructions feature the open-source Dart Editor tool. When you download
    Dart Editor, you also get the Dart-to-JavaScript compiler and a version of
    Chromium (nicknamed <span class="emphasis"><em>Dartium</em></span>) that includes the Dart
    VM.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h4 class="title">Note</h4><p>If you run into trouble installing and using Dart Editor, see
