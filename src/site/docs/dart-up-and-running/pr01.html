<p>When we joined Google and entered the fascinating world of web browser
  development more than six years ago, the web was a different place. It was
  clear that a new breed of web apps was emerging, but the performance of the
  underlying platform left much to be desired. Given our background in
  designing and implementing virtual machines, building a high performance
  JavaScript engine seemed like an interesting challenge. It was. We
  implemented the V8 JavaScript engine from scratch and shipped it as part of
  Google Chrome in 2008, and we are very proud of the positive performance
  impact our work seems to have had on the entire browser industry.</p><p>Even though recent performance gains in web browsers have shattered
  most limits on how large and complex web apps can be, building large,
  high-performance web apps remains hard. Without good abstraction mechanisms
  and clean semantics, developers often end up with complex and convoluted
  code. Naturally, this problem gets exacerbated as the codebase grows. We
  designed the Dart programming language to solve this exact problem, and we
  hope that programmers will be more productive as a result.</p><p>Over the past year, we have read and written a lot of Dart code, and
  it is very satisfying to see how Dart inspires programmers to strive for
  concise, elegant programs. There is something very enjoyable about
  incrementally transforming prototypes into maintainable production software
  through refactorings and adding type annotations—and it definitely feels
  like Dart as a language scales well from small experiments to large projects
  with lots of code.</p><p><em class="citetitle">Dart: Up and Running</em> is a practical guide that
  introduces the Dart programming language and teaches you how to build Dart
  applications. We hope you will enjoy the book and Dart.</p>
