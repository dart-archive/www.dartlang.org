# {{ page.title }}

Dart provides several tools to help you write and deploy your web and
command-line apps. These tools include:

[pub: The Dart package and asset manager](#pub-the-dart-package-and-asset-manager)

:   Download and install packages of libraries,
    prepare your app for deployment, and more.

[Dart Editor](#dart-editor)

:   Edit, run, and debug web and command-line apps.

[Dartium: Chromium with the Dart VM](#dartium-chromium-with-the-dart-vm)

:   Run Dart web apps. This is a special build of Chromium (the project
    behind Google Chrome).

[dart2js: The Dart-to-JavaScript compiler](#dart2js-the-dart-to-javascript-compiler)

:   Convert your web app to JavaScript, so it can run in non-Dartium
    browsers.

[dart: The standalone Dart VM](#dart-the-standalone-vm)

:   Run your command-line apps—server-side scripts, programs, servers,
    and any other apps that don’t run in a browser.

[dartanalyzer: The static analyzer](#dartanalyzer-the-static-analyzer)

:   Analyze your Dart source from the command line.

All of these tools are in the Dart Editor bundle, since the editor uses
them. You can also download Dartium separately, and you can download an
SDK that includes pub, dart2js, dart, dartanalyzer, and more. See the
[Tools page](/tools/) for links and details.

The tools are in the `dart-sdk/bin` directory of your Dart installation
directory. If you intend to use tools such as pub, dart2js, and dart
from the command line, add the `bin` directory to your path.


## pub: The Dart Package and Asset Manager

The documentation for pub has moved to
[dartlang.org/tools/pub/](/tools/pub/).


## Dart Editor

We already introduced Dart Editor in
[Up and Running](ch01.html#up-and-running).
Here are some more tips on using
Dart Editor, with information such as [specifying a
browser](#ch04-editor-run-non-dartium) and [compiling to
JavaScript](#ch04-editor-dart2js). If you run into a problem, see
[Troubleshooting Dart
Editor.](/tools/editor/troubleshoot.html) Dart
Editor is updated frequently, so it probably looks different from what
you see here. For the latest information, see the [Dart Editor
documentation.](/editor)


### Viewing Samples
{:.no_toc}

The Welcome page of Dart Editor displays a few samples. To open a
sample and look at its source code, click the sample’s image.

If you don’t see the Welcome page, you probably closed it. Get it back
with **Tools \> Welcome Page**.


### Managing the Files View
{:.no_toc}

The Files view shows the files that implement the libraries included in
Dart, installed packages, as well as all the apps that you create or
open.

#### Adding apps
{:.no_toc}

Here’s how to open an app, which makes it appear in your Files view:

1.  Go to the **File** menu, and choose **Open Existing Folder...**. Or
    use the keyboard shortcut (**Ctrl+O** or, on Mac, **Cmd+O**).

2.  Browse to the directory that contains the app’s files.

3.  Click **Open**.

The directory and all its files appear in the Files view.

#### Removing apps
{:.no_toc}

You can remove an app from the Files view, either with or without
deleting its files.

Right-click (or Ctrl+click) the directory and choose **Delete**. If you
want to delete the app’s files permanently, then in the dialog that
comes up, choose **Delete project contents on disk**.


### Creating Apps
{:.no_toc}

It’s easy to create a simple web or command-line app from scratch:

1.  Click the New Application button ![](images/newapp.png) (at the
    upper left of Dart Editor). Alternatively, choose **File \> New
    Application** from the Dart Editor menu. A dialog appears.

2.  Type in a name for your application—for example, `hello_web`. If you
    don’t like the default parent directory, type in a new location or
    browse to choose the location.

3.  Unless you really don’t want files to be automatically created for
    you, make sure **Generate sample content** is selected.

4.  Select the kind of application you’re writing, such as command line,
    web, or web using
    [Polymer.dart.](/polymer-dart/)

5.  Click **Finish** to create a directory with initial files for the
    app.

    A default Dart file appears in the Edit view, and its directory
    appears in the Files view. Your Dart Editor window should look
    something like the following screenshot.

    ![A new app, pre-filled with basic, runnable code](images/daur_0401.png)


### Editing Apps
{:.no_toc}

Dart Editor provides the basic editing functionality you’d expect, plus
features such as Dart code completion, API browsing, support for
refactoring, and the ability to search multiple files.

#### Using autocomplete
{:.no_toc}

Autocomplete suggestions look something like the following figure.

![Autocomplete suggestions](images/daur_0402.png)

Suggestions appear when you either:

-   Type a class or variable name, and then type a period.

    For example, type `document.` or `DateTime.` and pause a moment.
    Once the suggestions appear, continue typing to pare down the list.

-   Type **Ctrl+Space**.

    For example, type `Dat`, then Ctrl+Space to see a list of classes
    that start with “Dat”.

When the suggestions come up, you can click, type, or use the arrow keys
to select the one you want. Press Enter or Return to choose a
suggestion, or Esc to dismiss the panel.


#### Browsing APIs
{:.no_toc}

With Dart Editor you can easily find where APIs are declared. You can
also outline the contents of a Dart file.

##### Finding out more about an API

To get more information about an API item-variable, method, type,
library, and so on-hover the mouse over the item in the Edit view. Dart
Editor displays a popup that provides more information about that item.

To go to the declaration of an API item, either within the same .dart
file or in another file:

1.  In the Edit view of a Dart file, click on an API item. Dart Editor
    highlights the item and all other occurrences of the item.

2.  Right click.

3.  Choose **Open Declaration** in the menu.

    The editor displays the file that declares the item. For example, if
    you open the declaration for querySelector, the file that declares
    the `querySelector()` function appears.

##### Outlining a file’s contents

Press **Alt+O** (**Option+O** on Mac) or right-click and choose
**Outline File**.

A panel comes up displaying the classes, methods, and fields declared in
the current Dart file. For example, the outline for the Sunflower
sample’s `sunflower.dart` file looks something like this:

![The Outline panel for the Sunflower sample](images/daur_0403.png)

You can reduce the size of the list by typing one or more characters.
For example, if you type **c**, only the **center** and **context**
variables appear.

If you choose an item from the list—for example, **centerX**— the editor
scrolls to its declaration.

Alternatively, add a more permanent outline view by choosing **Tools \>
Outline**.

### Refactoring
{:.no_toc}

To change the name of an item throughout your code, put the cursor
within (or double-click) the item’s name in the Edit view, and
right-click and choose **Rename...**.

You can rename almost anything—local variables, function parameters,
fields, methods, types, top-level functions, library prefixes, top-level
compilation units, and more. An example of renaming a top-level
compilation unit is changing the name of a file that’s sourced by a
library.

### Searching
{:.no_toc}

The search field at the upper right of the Dart Editor window is an easy
way to go directly to:

-   Types

-   Files

-   Text inside of files

The scope of a text search is every file in your Files view. Results for
text searches come up in a Search view. Within that view, double-click a
file to see it in the Edit view. All occurrences of the search string in
the Edit view are highlighted.


### Running Apps
{:.no_toc}

To run any Dart app, click Dart Editor’s Run button
![](images/run.png) while a file in that app is selected. If you’re
working on a web app, Dart Editor brings up a browser window that
displays the app’s HTML page, with the app’s code running inside it.

When you run a web application using Dart Editor, by default the app
uses the copy of Dartium that’s included in the Dart Editor download,
with the Dart code executing directly in the browser. If your launch
configuration specifies a browser, then Dart Editor uses
[dart2js](/tools/dart2js/) to compile the Dart code to JavaScript
that executes in the browser.

### Specifying launch configurations
{:.no_toc}

Use **Run \> Manage Launches** to specify as many launch configurations
as you like.

For web apps, you can specify the following:

-   HTML file or URL to open

-   arguments to pass to the browser; for example,
    `--allow-file-access-from-files`

-   checked mode (Dartium only)

-   enable experimental features (Dartium only)

-   whether to show the browser’s stdout and stderr output (Dartium
    only; useful for diagnosing Dartium crashes)

For example, a web app might have a launch configuration for Dartium and
several more configurations corresponding to additional browsers you
want to test.

You can specify the following for command-line apps:

-   .dart file to execute

-   working directory

-   arguments to pass to the app

-   checked mode

### Running in production mode
{:.no_toc}

By default, apps run in checked mode. To run in production mode instead,
disable checked mode in your app’s launch configuration:

1.  Run your app at least once, so that it has a launch configuration.

2.  Choose **Run \> Manage Launches**, or click the little arrow to the
    right of the Run button ![](images/run.png) and choose **Manage
    Launches**.

3.  In the Manage Launches dialog, find a launch configuration for your
    app. Click it if it isn’t already selected.

4.  Unselect **Run in checked mode**.

    ![To run in production mode, unselect checked
    mode](images/daur_0404.png)

5.  Click **Apply** to save your change, or **Run** to save it and run
    your app.

For details about checked mode and production mode, see
[Runtime Modes](ch02.html#runtime-modes).

### Specifying a browser for JavaScript launches
{:.no_toc}

To specify the browser in which to run the JavaScript version of your
web apps:

1.  Choose **Dart Editor \> Preferences**.

2.  Click **Run and Debug**.

3.  Unless you want to use the default system browser, unselect **Use
    default system browser** and specify the location of the browser you
    want to use. *Example:* /Applications/Firefox.app

4.  Click **OK** to save your changes.

Now whenever you run an app as JavaScript, Dart Editor invokes your
browser of choice.

Alternatively, you can run your app as JavaScript using the default
browser setting and then copy and paste the URL into a different
browser.


### Debugging Apps
{:.no_toc}

You can debug both command-line and web apps with Dart Editor. Some
tips:

-   Set breakpoints by double-clicking in the left margin of the Edit
    view.

-   Use the Debugger view to view your app’s state and control its
    execution. By default, the Debugger view is to the right of the Edit
    view and appears when you first hit a breakpoint
    (see the following figure).

-   To see the value of a variable, mouse over it, look in the Debugger
    view, or use an Expression ![](images/watchlist_view.gif).

-   To debug web apps, use Dart Editor with Dartium. While you’re
    debugging, Dart Editor takes the place of the Dartium console. For
    example, Dart Editor displays the output of `print()` statements.

![Using Dart Editor to debug the Sunflower sample app](images/daur_0406.png)


### Compiling to JavaScript
{:.no_toc}

You might not need to do anything to compile your code to JavaScript.
When you run an app using a launch configuration that [specifies a
browser](#ch04-editor-run-non-dartium), Dart Editor automatically
compiles the app to JavaScript before executing it in the browser.

However, you can also compile Dart code to JavaScript without running
the app. Just choose **Tools \> Generate JavaScript**. Another option is
using dart2js from the command line (see
[dart2js: The Dart-to-JavaScript Compiler](/tools/dart2js/)).


### Other Features
{:.no_toc}

Dart Editor has many additional features, including customization and
keyboard alternatives.

### Customizing Dart Editor
{:.no_toc}

You can customize the editor’s font, margins, key bindings, and more
using the Preferences dialog. To bring up the dialog, choose **Tools \>
Preferences** (on Mac: **Dart Editor \> Preferences**).

You can also customize which views you see in Dart Editor, as well as
their size and position. To add views, use the **Tools** menu. To remove
a view, click its **X**. To move a view, drag its tab to a different
position, either within or outside of the Dart Editor window. To resize
a view, drag its edges.

### Keyboard alternatives
{:.no_toc}

To get a list of all keyboard alternatives, choose **Help \> Key
Assist**.

![Help \> Key Assist](images/daur_0407.png)


## Dartium: Chromium with the Dart VM

The documentation for Dartium has moved to
[dartlang.org/tools/dartium/](/tools/dartium/).

## dart2js: The Dart-to-JavaScript Compiler

The documentation for dart2js has moved to
[dartlang.org/tools/dart2js/](/tools/dart2js/).


## dart: The Standalone VM

The documentation for dart has moved to
[dartlang.org/tools/dart-vm/](/tools/dart-vm/).


## dartanalyzer: The Static Analyzer

You can use the *dartanalyzer* tool (`bin/dartanalyzer`) to statically
analyze your code at the command line, checking for errors and warnings
that are specified in the [Dart Language
Specification.](/docs/spec/)

> **Note**
>
> Dart Editor performs the same analysis that dartanalyzer does. A
> previous static analyzer, called *dart\_analyzer*, is no longer
> supported.


### Basic Usage
{:.no_toc}

Here’s an example of testing a Dart file:

{% prettify sh %}
dartanalyzer --package-root=code/packages test.dart
{% endprettify %}

As the following table shows,
the exit code of dartanalyzer tells you whether the code
passed analysis.

|-----------+--------------------------------
| Exit code | Description
|-----------+--------------------------------
| 0         | No issues found
| 1         | Warnings found (but no errors)
| 2         | Errors found
{:.table .table-striped}


### Options
{:.no_toc}

You can use the following command-line options with dartanalyzer:

{% comment %}
{NOTE:
I'm still not documenting --perf. It's displayed by --help but seems of
limited use to most developers. I'm also not documenting the following,
which I got from sdk/bin/dartanalyzer or pkg/analyzer/lib/options.dart
but aren't displayed by help: -batch|--batch|-b (though -b doesn't seem
to be treated specially by the script), --ignore-unrecognized-flags
(doesn't seem to change the output), --fatal-warnings, --warnings (only
for SDK developers?), --show-sdk-warnings (deprecated)}
{% endcomment %}
