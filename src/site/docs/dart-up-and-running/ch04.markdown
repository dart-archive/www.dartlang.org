Dart provides several tools to help you write and deploy your web and
command-line apps. These tools include:

[pub: The Dart package and asset manager](/tools/pub/)

:   Download and install packages of libraries,
    prepare your app for deployment, and more.

[Dartium: Chromium with the Dart VM](/tools/dartium/)

:   Run Dart web apps. This is a special build of Chromium (the project
    behind Google Chrome).

[dart2js: The Dart-to-JavaScript compiler](/tools/dart2js/)

:   Convert your web app to JavaScript, so it can run in non-Dartium
    browsers.

[dart: The standalone VM](/tools/dart-vm/)

:   Run your command-line apps—server-side scripts, programs, servers,
    and any other apps that don’t run in a browser.

[dartanalyzer: The static analyzer](https://github.com/dart-lang/analyzer_cli#dartanalyzer)

:   Analyze your Dart source from the command line.

Except for Dartium, all of these tools are in the Dart SDK.
Dartium is a separate download.

For information about these and other tools,
see [Dart Tools](/tools/).
