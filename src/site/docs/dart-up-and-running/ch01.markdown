Welcome to Dart, an open-source, batteries-included developer platform
for building structured HTML5 web apps. This chapter tells you why
Google created Dart, what’s cool about Dart, and how to write and run
your first Dart app.

Dart provides not only a new language, but libraries, an editor, a
virtual machine (VM), a browser that can run Dart apps natively, and a
compiler to JavaScript. Dart aims to be a more productive way to build
the high-performance, modern apps that users demand.

## Why Google Created Dart

Google cares a lot about helping to make the web great. We write a lot
of web apps, many of them quite sophisticated—think Gmail, Google
Calendar, Google+, and more. We want web apps to load quickly, run
smoothly, and present engaging and fun experiences to users. We want
developers of all backgrounds to be able to build great experiences for
the browser.

As an example of Google’s commitment to the web, consider the Google
Chrome browser. Google created it to spur competition at a time when the
web platform seemed to be stagnating. It worked.
As the following figure shows, browser
speed has increased immensely since Chrome’s introduction in 2008.

> **Note**
>
> The JavaScript engine known as _V8_ is responsible for much of Chrome’s
> speed. Many of the V8 engineers are now working on the Dart project.

better)](images/daur_0101.png)

The number of new features in browsers has also increased, with APIs
such as WebGL, FileSystem, Web workers, and WebSockets. Browsers now
have automatic update capabilities, frequently delivering new features
and fixes directly to the user. Mobile devices such as tablets and
phones also have modern browsers with many HTML5 features.

Despite these improvements in the web platform, the developer experience
hasn’t improved as much as we’d like. We believe it should be easier to
build larger, more complex web apps. It’s taken far too long for
productive tools to emerge, and they still don’t match the capabilities
offered by other developer platforms. You shouldn’t have to be
intimately familiar with web programming to start building great apps
for the modern web. And even though JavaScript engines are getting
faster, web apps still start up much too slowly.

We expect Dart to help in two main ways:

-   *Better performance:* As VM engineers, the designers of Dart know
    how to build a language for performance. A more structured language
    is easier to optimize, and a fresh VM enables improvements such as
    faster startup.

-   *Better productivity:* Support for libraries and packages helps you
    work with other developers and easily reuse code from other
    projects. Types can make APIs clearer and easier to use. Tools help
    you refactor, navigate, and debug code.


## A Quick Look at the Dart Language

It’s hard to talk about a language without seeing it. Here’s a peek at a
small Dart program:

{% prettify dart %}
import 'dart:math';

class Point {
  num x, y;
  Point(this.x, this.y);
  num distanceTo(Point other) {
    var dx = x - other.x;
    var dy = y - other.y;
    return sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
  }
}

main() {
  var p = new Point(2, 3);
  var q = new Point(3, 4);
  print('distance from p to q = ${p.distanceTo(q)}');
}
{% endprettify %}

Of course, Dart’s main use case is building modern web apps. Programming
the browser is easy:

{% prettify dart %}
import 'dart:html';

main() {
  var button = new ButtonElement();
  button..id = 'confirm'
        ..text = 'Click to Confirm'
        ..classes.add('important')
        ..onClick.listen((e) => window.alert('Confirmed!'));
  querySelector('#registration').children.add(button);
}
{% endprettify %}

You’ll learn about the Dart language and libraries in Chapters 2 and 3.


## What’s Cool About Dart

Dart may look familiar, but don’t let that fool you. Dart has lots of
cool features to help give you a productive and fun experience building
the next generation of awesome web apps.

*Dart is easy to learn.* A wide range of developers can learn Dart
quickly. It’s an object-oriented language with classes, single
inheritance, lexical scope, top-level functions, and a familiar syntax.
Most developers are up and running with Dart in just a few hours.

*Dart compiles to JavaScript.* Dart has been designed from the start to
compile to JavaScript, so that Dart apps can run across the entire
modern web. Every feature considered for the language must somehow be
translated to performant and logical JavaScript before it is added. Dart
draws a line in the sand and doesn’t support older, legacy browsers.

*Dart runs in the client and on the server.* The Dart virtual machine
(VM) can be integrated into a web browser, but it can also run
standalone on the command line. With built-in library support for files,
directories, sockets, and even web servers, you can use Dart for full
end-to-end apps.

*Dart comes with a lightweight editor.* You can use Dart Editor to
write, launch, and debug Dart apps. The editor can help you with code
completion, detecting potential bugs, debugging both command-line and
web apps, and even refactoring. Dart Editor isn’t required for writing
Dart; it’s just a tool that can help you write better code faster.

*Dart supports types, without requiring them.* You can omit types when
you want to move very quickly, aren’t sure what structure to take, or
simply want to express something you can’t with the type system. You can
add types as your program matures, the structure becomes more evident,
and more developers join the project. Dart’s optional types are static
type annotations that act as documentation, clearly expressing your
intent. Using types means that fewer comments are required to document
the code, and tools can give better warnings and error messages.

*Dart scales from small scripts to large, complex apps.* Web development
is very much an iterative process. With the reload button acting as your
compiler, building the seed of a web app is often a fun experience of
writing a few functions just to experiment. As the idea grows, you can
add more code and structure. Thanks to Dart’s support for top-level
functions, optional types, classes, and libraries, your Dart programs
can start small and grow over time. Tools such as Dart Editor help you
refactor and navigate your code as it evolves.

*Dart has a wide array of built-in libraries.* The core library supports
built-in types and other fundamental features such as collections,
dates, and regular expressions. Web apps can use the HTML library—think
DOM programming, but optimized for Dart. Command-line apps can use the
I/O library to work with files, directories, sockets, and servers. Other
libraries include URI, UTF, Crypto, Math, and Unit test.

*Dart supports safe, simple concurrency with isolates.* Traditional
shared-memory threads are difficult to debug and can lead to deadlocks.
Dart’s isolates, inspired by Erlang, provide an easier to understand
model for running isolated, but concurrent, portions of your code.
Spawning new isolates is cheap and fast, and no state is shared.

*Dart supports code sharing.* Traditional web programming workflows
can’t integrate third-party libraries from arbitrary sources or
frameworks. With the Dart package manager (pub) and language features
such as libraries, you can easily discover, install, and integrate code
from across the web and enterprise.

*Dart is open source.* Dart was born for the web, and it’s available
under a BSD-style license. You can find the project’s [issue tracker and
source repository](http://dart.googlecode.com) online. Maybe you’ll
submit the next patch?


## Up and Running

Now that you know something about Dart, get ready to code! These
instructions feature the open-source Dart Editor tool. When you download
Dart, you not only get Dart Editor, but also tools such as the
Dart-to-JavaScript compiler and a version of Chromium (nicknamed
*Dartium*) that includes the Dart VM.

> **Note**
>
> If you run into trouble installing and using Dart Editor, see
> [Troubleshooting Dart
> Editor.](http://www.dartlang.org/tools/editor/troubleshoot.html)


### Step 1: Download and Install the Software

In this step, you’ll install Dart Editor and, if necessary, a Java
runtime environment. (To avoid having to modify the PATH environment
variable, you can install the JRE under your Dart installation
directory, in a subdirectory named `jre`.)

1.  [Download Dart Editor](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/download.html).

2.  Unarchive the file you downloaded. The resulting directory, which
    we’ll call your *Dart installation directory*, contains the
    `DartEditor` executable and several subdirectories.

3.  If you don’t already have a Java runtime, download and install it.
    Dart Editor requires Java version 6 or higher.


### Step 2: Launch the Editor

Go to your Dart installation directory, and double-click the
**DartEditor** executable![](images/Dart_Logo_21.png).

You should see the Dart Editor application window appear, looking
something like the following figure.

![Dart Editor and its Welcome page](images/daur_0102.png)


### Step 3: Open and Run a Demo

The Dart Editor bundle comes with several demos and samples. In this
step, you’ll open a web app and run it in Dartium.

1.  Click the **Welcome** tab. Or choose **Welcome Page** from the
    **Tools** menu.

2.  In the Welcome tab, click the image labeled **Sunflower**. Dart
    Editor creates a copy of the [Sunflower app’s
    directory,](http://code.google.com/p/dart/source/browse/trunk/dart/samples/sunflower/)
    and the Editor view displays the contents of *web/sunflower.dart*.

3.  Click the Run button ![](images/run.png). Dart Editor launches
    Dartium, which displays *sunflower.html*.

<aside class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
**Warning:**
Dartium is a technical preview, and it might have security and
stability issues. *Do not use Dartium as your primary browser!*
</aside>

4.  Move the slider to change the sunflower's display, as shown in
    the following figure.

    ![The Sunflower sample running in Dartium](images/daur_0105.png)


### Step 4: Create and Run an App

It’s easy to create a simple web or command-line app from scratch. This
step walks you through creating and running a command-line app.

1.  Click the New Application button ![](images/newapp.png) (at the
    upper left of Dart Editor). Alternatively, choose **File \> New
    Application** from the Dart Editor menu, or click the **Create an
    Application…** button in the Welcome page. A dialog appears (see
    the next figure).

2.  Type in a name for your application—for example, `hello_world`. If
    you don’t like the default directory, type in a new location or
    browse to choose the location.

3.  Make sure **Generate sample content** and **Command-line
    application** are selected. Then click **Finish** to create the
    initial files for the app.

    <img src="images/daur_0103.png"
         alt="Create command-line or web apps with Dart Editor"
         class="thinborder">

    A default Dart file appears in the Edit view, and its directory
    appears in the Files view. Your Dart Editor window should look
    something like the following screenshot.

    ![Dart Editor displaying a new app’s files](images/daur_0104.png)

4.  Click the Run button ![](images/run.png) to run your new app.

    For command-line apps, the output of `print()` appears at the bottom
    right, in a new tab next to the Problems tab.
