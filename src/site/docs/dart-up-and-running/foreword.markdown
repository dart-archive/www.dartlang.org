<em>Lars Bak and Kasper Lund</em>

When we joined Google and entered the fascinating world of web browser
development more than six years ago, the web was a different place. It was
clear that a new breed of web apps was emerging, but the performance of the
underlying platform left much to be desired. Given our background in
designing and implementing virtual machines, building a high performance
JavaScript engine seemed like an interesting challenge. It was. We
implemented the V8 JavaScript engine from scratch and shipped it as part of
Google Chrome in 2008, and we are very proud of the positive performance
impact our work seems to have had on the entire browser industry.

Even though recent performance gains in web browsers have shattered
most limits on how large and complex web apps can be, building large,
high-performance web apps remains hard. Without good abstraction mechanisms
and clean semantics, developers often end up with complex and convoluted
code. Naturally, this problem gets exacerbated as the codebase grows. We
designed the Dart programming language to solve this exact problem, and we
hope that programmers will be more productive as a result.

It is very satisfying to see how Dart inspires programmers to strive
for concise, elegant programs. There is something very enjoyable about
incrementally transforming prototypes into maintainable production software
through refactorings and adding type annotations—and it definitely feels
like Dart as a language scales well from small experiments to large projects
with lots of code.

_Dart: Up and Running_ is a practical guide that
introduces the Dart programming language and teaches you how to build Dart
applications. We hope you will enjoy the book and Dart.
