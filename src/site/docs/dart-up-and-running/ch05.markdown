This chapter points out some of the useful and fun features of the Dart
language and libraries that are used in Dartiverse Search, a
client-server app.

<aside class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
  **Note:**
  This chapter should be updated or deleted.
  It describes an
  [old version of Dartiverse Search](https://github.com/dart-lang/sample-dartiverse-search/tree/eff1219dad03e61bc6d0849995fe990fd75760e7)
  that doesn't use Dart's new `async` and `await` keywords,
  and it depends on Dart Editor,
  which is [retired as of 1.11](http://news.dartlang.org/2015/04/the-present-and-future-of-editors-and.html).

As the screenshot shows, Dartiverse Search looks for a
user-entered string in GitHub and StackOverflow. The app is
asynchronous, adding results as they're found, so the UI is always
responsive.

## How to run Dartiverse Search {#how-to-run-dartiverse-search}

You can use Dart Editor to get and run Dartiverse Search.

1.  In Dart Editor, go to the Welcome page. (If you don't see it, choose
    **Tools \> Welcome Page**.)

2.  In the demo section, click **Dartiverse Search** to create a copy of
    the dartiverse\_search package.

    <aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
    **Note:**
    If you aren’t using Dart Editor, find the [Dartiverse
    Search source code in GitHub](https://github.com/dart-lang/sample-dartiverse-search).
    </aside>

3.  Use **Tools \> Pub Build** to build the package.

4.  Select `bin/server.dart` and click the **Run** button. You should
    see a message that the search server is running at
    http://127.0.0.1:9223/.

5.  Enter that URL into any modern browser.
    The search client UI should appear.


## How Dartiverse Search works {#how-dartiverse-search-works}

The search server is an HTTP server that provides a WebSocket interface.
The search client uses that WebSocket interface as a bi-directional
communication channel with the server. The client sends search requests
to the server over the WebSocket, and the server replies with any
results and then a final, "search done" message.

The server starts things off by binding to localhost, port 9223, and
listening for requests to the WebSocket: `ws://127.0.0.1:9223/ws`.
Search clients can connect using that URL.

The real communication between client and server happens when the user
enters a search string. As the following diagram shows,
the client sends a JSON-encoded
search request to the server. The server extracts the search string from
the request and sends it to a series of search engines. Each search
engine searches a specific site—for example, GitHub—using whatever API
that site supports. Whenever a search engine finds a result, the server
forwards that result to the client, again using a JSON-encoded message.

![Communication in Dartiverse Search](images/daur_0502.png)

The search server implements an HTTP server that both provides content
for the client UI and listens for WebSocket requests.

The client code is split between HTML (page structure), CSS (page look),
and JavaScript (logic and behavior). That’s typical of web clients.

The twist is that this client’s JavaScript code is produced from Dart
code, thanks to the dart2js compiler. Any modern browser can run this
JavaScript code.


## The client's HTML code {#the-clients-html-code}

The client's UI is simple. It has a search field, implemented as an
\<input\> element named "q". It displays output in two \<div\>s named
"status" and "results".

{% prettify html %}
<!-- In web/index.html: -->

<input type="search" placeholder="Search" value="" id="q" disabled />
<div id="status"></div>
...
  <div id="results"></div>
{% endprettify %}

A couple of \<script\> tags tell the browser to execute the client’s
Dart or JavaScript code:

{% prettify html %}
<script type="application/dart" src="client.dart"></script>
<script src="packages/browser/dart.js"></script>
{% endprettify %}

The first line works in browsers that have an embedded Dart VM and so
can execute Dart code; currently, only Dartium qualifies.

The second line is important for every other browser. It executes
dart.js, which is a standard script that converts all Dart \<script\>
tags to use foo.dart.js instead of foo.dart, with the assumption that
foo.dart.js is a JavaScript version of foo.dart. For non-Dartium
browsers, dart.js changes the first \<script\> tag to the following:

{% prettify html %}
<script src="client.dart.js"></script>
{% endprettify %}

You can get dart.js with the browser package from pub. See the
[dart2js documentation](/tools/dart2js/) for more
information about compiling Dart code into its JavaScript equivalent.


## The client's Dart code {#the-clients-dart-code}

Dart code (`web/client.dart`) provides the client’s logic, using the DOM
to interact with UI elements. For example, the client’s Dart code uses
the DOM to find the div where the client displays messages.


### Finding DOM elements {#finding-dom-elements}
{:.no_toc}

The client app uses dart:html’s top-level `querySelector()` function to
get the client’s UI elements from the DOM:

<!-- web/client.dart -->
{% prettify html %}
SearchInputElement searchElement = querySelector('#q');
DivElement statusElement = querySelector('#status');
DivElement resultsElement = querySelector('#results');
{% endprettify %}

The `querySelector()` method uses a selector string that identifies an
element in the DOM. See
[Finding elements](ch03.html#finding-elements) for more about selectors.

<aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
**Note:**
This code could just use `var` instead of specifying types
([SearchInputElement](https://api.dartlang.org/dart_html/SearchInputElement.html)
and [DivElement](https://api.dartlang.org/dart_html/DivElement.html))
for the elements. Whoever writes the code gets to choose whether to
specify types.
</aside>


### Handling events {#handling-events}
{:.no_toc}

The client app uses `onChange.listen()` to register a handler that
reacts to user input. Whenever the user presses Enter, the search field
fires a change event, and the handler kicks off a search.

{% prettify dart %}
searchElement.onChange.listen((e) {
  // ...Start the search...
});
{% endprettify %}


### Getting and setting properties {#getting-and-setting-properties}
{:.no_toc}

The change event handler gets and sets the text in the search field
using the `value` property.

{% prettify dart %}
search(searchElement.value);
searchElement.value = '';
{% endprettify %}


### Adding DOM elements {#adding-dom-elements}
{:.no_toc}

Every time the search client receives a result on the WebSocket, the
client creates a new div (`result`) to display it. The client then adds
that new div to the "results" div (`resultsElement`).

{% prettify dart %}
void addResult(String source, String title, String link) {
  var result = new DivElement();
  result.children.add(new HeadingElement.h2()..innerHtml = source);
  result.children.add(
      new AnchorElement(href: link)
      ..innerHtml = title
      ..target = '_blank');
  result.classes.add('result');
  resultsElement.children.add(result);
}
{% endprettify %}

This code uses method cascades to avoid creating variables to
temporarily hold the new HeadingElement and AnchorElement.


### Encoding and decoding messages {#encoding-and-decoding-messages}
{:.no_toc}

The dart:convert library's global `JSON` object lets you encode and
decode JSON-formatted messages. JSON is an easy way to provide string
message data to WebSockets. Using JSON also gives a bit of structure to
the messages and leaves the door open to creating more detailed messages
in the future.

The `JSON.encode()` method converts a Dart object to a JSON-encoded
string, and the `JSON.decode()` method converts a JSON string back into
a Dart object.

Here's the code that creates a JSON-encoded search request:

{% prettify dart %}
var request = {
  'request': 'search',
  'input': input
};
webSocket.send(JSON.encode(request));
{% endprettify %}

Here’s how the client decodes and processes a JSON response from the
server:

{% prettify dart %}
var json = JSON.decode(data);
var response = json['response'];
switch (response) {
  case 'searchResult':
    addResult(json['source'], json['title'], json['link']);
    break;
  // ...
}
{% endprettify %}

For more information, read about
[dart:convert](ch03.html#dartconvert---decoding-and-encoding-json-utf-8-and-more).


### Communicating with WebSockets {#communicating-with-websockets}
{:.no_toc}

The search client connects to the WebSocket by calling the WebSocket
constructor with the argument 'ws://127.0.0.1:9223/ws'. Then it adds
event handlers for open and error events. The open event handler, in
turn, registers handlers for message and close events. Here's the
relevant code:

{% prettify dart %}
class Client {
  // ...
  WebSocket webSocket;
  // ...

  Client() {
    // ...
    connect();
  }

  void connect() {
    // ...
    webSocket = new WebSocket('ws://${Uri.base.host}:${Uri.base.port}/ws');
    webSocket.onOpen.first.then((_) {
      onConnected();
      webSocket.onClose.first.then((_) {
        print("Connection disconnected to ${webSocket.url}");
        onDisconnected();
      });
    webSocket.onError.first.then((_) {/*...*/});
  }

  void onConnected() {
    // ...
    webSocket.onMessage.listen((e) {
      handleMessage(e.data);
    });
  }
  // ...
}
{% endprettify %}

To send a message on the WebSocket connection, the client invokes
WebSocket's `send()` method:

{% prettify dart %}
webSocket.send(JSON.encode(request));
{% endprettify %}

When the client receives a message, it decodes the JSON data (as you saw
before) and updates the UI to match:

{% prettify dart %}
void handleMessage(data) {
  var json = JSON.decode(data);
  var response = json['response'];
  switch (response) {
    case 'searchResult':
      addResult(json['source'], json['title'], json['link']);
      break;

    case 'searchDone':
      setStatus(resultsElement.children.isEmpty
          ? "$mostRecentSearch: No results found"
          : "$mostRecentSearch: ${resultsElement.children.length} results found");
      break;

    default:
      print("Invalid response: '$response'");
  }
}
{% endprettify %}


## The server's code {#the-servers-code}

The main code for the search server is under the `bin` directory, in a
file named `server.dart`. It's responsible for serving static files,
managing WebSocket connections, and starting searches.

The code for performing the searches is in a custom library, called
search\_engine, that's implemented in files under the `lib` directory.


### Serving static files {#serving-static-files}
{:.no_toc}

The search server uses HttpServer (from dart:io), Platform (also from
dart:io), and VirtualDirectory (from the http\_server package) to
implement a basic web server. Here's the code that initializes the web
server and serves static files:

{% prettify dart %}
var buildPath = Platform.script.resolve('../build').toFilePath();
// ...
int port = 9223;

HttpServer.bind(InternetAddress.LOOPBACK_IP_V4, port).then((server) {
  // ...
  var router = new Router(server);
  // ...
  var virDir = new http_server.VirtualDirectory(buildPath);
  virDir.jailRoot = false;
  virDir.allowDirectoryListing = true;
  virDir.directoryHandler = (dir, request) {
    var indexUri = new Uri.file(dir.path).resolve('index.html');
    virDir.serveFile(new File(indexUri.toFilePath()), request);
  };
  // ...
  virDir.serve(router.defaultStream);
  // ...
});
{% endprettify %}

The call to `HttpServer.bind()` creates a web server that handles HTTP
requests to the address 127.0.0.1:9223 (also known as localhost:9223).

Once the future returned by `bind()` completes, the code creates a
Router (more about that later) and a VirtualDirectory (`virDir`).
Because packages used by the client are set up using symbolic links
pointing outside the root directory, `../build`, the `jailRoot` property
of `virDir` must be false. (By default, symbolic links aren't allowed
outside the root directory.) The next line sets `allowDirectoryListing`
to true, allowing the web server to respond to paths that don't include
a filename. Next, a custom directory handler overrides the default
directory listing code, so that directories display `index.html` instead
of a list of files.

Once the VirtualDirectory is all set up, invoking the `serve()` method
connects `virDir` to a stream of HTTP requests. This stream consists of
every HTTP request that the router doesn't handle specially—for example,
the stream doesn't include WebSocket connection requests.


### Managing WebSocket connections {#managing-websocket-connections}
{:.no_toc}

The search server uses the Router class from the [route
package](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/route) to serve dynamic
content. In this app, the main purpose of the router is to filter out
upgrade HTTP requests for /ws and to handle them as WebSocket
connections. The code uses dart:io's WebSocketTransformer class to
perform the conversion:

{% prettify dart %}
router.serve('/ws')
  .transform(new WebSocketTransformer())
  .listen(handleWebSocket);
{% endprettify %}

Here's the custom `handleWebSocket()` method, which handles events on
the WebSocket:

{% prettify dart %}
void handleWebSocket(WebSocket webSocket) {
  webSocket
    .map((string) => JSON.decode(string))
    .listen((json) {
      var request = json['request'];
      switch (request) {
        case 'search':
          // ...Kick off searches, and register handlers for results...
          break;
        // ...
      }
    }, onError: (error) {/*...*/});
}
{% endprettify %}

The call to `webSocket.map()` parses all the messages that the client
sends over the WebSocket, converting each JSON-formatted message into an
object. Then, after checking the message format, the handler initiates
searches on GitHub and StackOverflow.

Here's the code from the 'search' case that starts the searches and
handles results as they come in:

{% prettify dart %}
for (var engine in searchEngines) {
  engine.search(input)
    .listen((result) {
      var response = {
        'response': 'searchResult',
        'source': engine.name,
        'title': result.title,
        'link': result.link
      };
      webSocket.add(JSON.encode(response));
    }, onError: (error) {
      // ...
    }, onDone: () {
      done++;
      if (done == searchEngines.length) {
        webSocket.add(JSON.encode({ 'response': 'searchDone' }));
      }
    });
{% endprettify %}
<!-- TODO: check that code. add more }s? -->

Each engine can return up to 3 results, but the WebSocket handler
doesn't wait around for those results. Instead, a listener handles each
result as it arrives, constructing a JSON-formatted message and using
`webSocket.add()` to forward the result to the client. Once both engines
have finished sending any results, the search server sends a
'searchDone' message to the client.


### Using web APIs {#using-web-apis}
{:.no_toc}

The GitHub and StackOverflow searches are implemented in `search()`
methods that take an input string and return a stream of SearchResult
objects. Here's an example from the GitHub `search()` method:

{% prettify dart %}
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http_client;
// ...
Stream<SearchResult> search(String input) {
  var query = {
    'q': 'language:dart $input'
  };
  var searchUri = new Uri.https(
      'api.github.com',
      '/search/repositories',
      query);
  var controller = new StreamController();
  http_client.get(searchUri)
    .then((http_client.Response response) {
      if (response.statusCode != HttpStatus.OK) {
        throw "Bad status code: ${response.statusCode}, "
              "message: ${response.reasonPhrase}";
      }
      var json = JSON.decode(response.body);
      json.putIfAbsent('items', () => []);
      json['items']
        .expand(/* Delete items with empty descriptions. */)
        .take(3)
        .forEach((item) {
          controller.add(new SearchResult(
              item['description'], item['html_url']));
        });
    })
    .catchError(controller.addError)
    .whenComplete(controller.close);
  return controller.stream;
}
{% endprettify %}

This method first constructs a search URI, using the `Uri.https()`
constructor from dart:core's Uri class. The third argument is a
Map\<String, String\> that specifies the Uri's query parameters. For
example, if the input string is 'polymer', then the URI is this:

`https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=language%3Adart+polymer`

Next, the method creates an instance of StreamController (a class from
dart:async) to create and manage the stream of results.

Next comes the search request, using the http package's `get()` function
to send an HTTP GET request to the search URI. The `get()` function
returns a Future\<Response\>. The `then()` method registers a handler
for the response, `catchError()` registers an error handler, and
`whenComplete()` registers a cleanup function. At this point, the
`search()` method returns the stream created by StreamController.

Once the response arrives, the response handler decodes it and adds the
first three reasonable results to the result stream. If an error occurs,
then an error goes in the result stream, causing the search client's
onError handler to execute. After either a successful completion or an
error, the stream closes and the search client's onDone handler
executes.


### Implementing a library {#implementing-a-library}
{:.no_toc}

The search server implements a library, named search\_engine, that
contains all the code for performing searches. The search\_engine
library is declared in `search_engine.dart`, with additional
implementation in `github_search_engine.dart` and
`stack_overflow_search_engine.dart`. Here's the code that sets up the
library:

{% prettify dart %}
// In search_engine.dart:

library search_engine;

import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:convert' show JSON;
import 'dart:io' show HttpStatus;
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http_client;

part 'github_search_engine.dart';
part 'stack_overflow_search_engine.dart';

// ...
{% endprettify %}

The other files in the library don't have imports. They do, however,
have `part of` statements, which let tools and programmers know which
library relies on these files:

{% prettify dart %}
// In github_search_engine.dart and stack_overflow_search_engine.dart:

part of search_engine;

// ...
{% endprettify %}

The implementation of the search\_engine library is split as follows:

search\_engine.dart

:   Contains two basic classes, SearchResult and SearchEngine. A
    SearchResult contains a title and a link. SearchEngine is an
    abstract class that defines a common API for all search engines: a
    `name` property and a `search()` method that takes a string argument
    and returns a Stream\<SearchResult\>.

github\_search\_engine.dart

:   Implements GithubSearchEngine, a SearchEngine subclass that searches
    GitHub for Dart projects that include the search string.

stack\_overflow\_search\_engine.dart

:   Implements StackOverflowSearchEngine, a SearchEngine subclass that
    searches StackOverflow for Dart questions with the search string in
    the title.

The bulk of the code is in the SearchEngine subclasses.


### Logging messages {#logging-messages}
{:.no_toc}

The search server uses the [logging
package](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/logging) to log messages at
varying levels of severity. Here's the code from `bin/server.dart` that
imports API from the logging package and creates a log:

{% prettify dart %}
import 'package:logging/logging.dart' show Logger, Level, LogRecord;
// ...
final Logger log = new Logger('DartiverseSearch');
{% endprettify %}

The Logger class has many methods for logging messages at pre-defined
levels. Here's an example of logging an informational message, which you
might use for debugging:

{% prettify dart %}
log.info('New WebSocket connection');
{% endprettify %}

Here's an example of logging a warning:

{% prettify dart %}
log.warning("Invalid request: '$request'");
{% endprettify %}

By default, the logging package doesn't do anything useful with the log
messages. You must configure the logging level and add a handler for the
log messages. Here's the code from `bin/server.dart` that creates and
configures the Logger object:

{% prettify dart %}
final Logger log = new Logger('DartiverseSearch');
// ...

void main() {
  // Set up logger.
  Logger.root.level = Level.ALL;
  Logger.root.onRecord.listen((LogRecord rec) {
    print('${rec.level.name}: ${rec.time}: ${rec.message}');
  });
  // ...
}
{% endprettify %}

Setting the level to `Level.ALL` makes all logging messages appear in
the onRecord stream. If you want only warnings to appear, you can set
the level to `Level.WARNING`.

For a list of all the levels and what they mean, see the [Level API
documentation.](https://api.dartlang.org/logging/Level.html) See the
[Logger API documentation](https://api.dartlang.org/logging/Logger.html)
for a list of methods that log messages.


## What next? {#what-next}

You’ve seen how the Dartiverse Search sample uses both server-side and
client-side Dart code to implement a web app. It makes use of both
built-in libraries and libraries from packages published on
pub.dartlang.org.

If you'd like to continue exploring Dartiverse Search, consider
improving its user interface or adding another search engine. If you'd
like to look at other samples, you can find them in Dart Editor and in
