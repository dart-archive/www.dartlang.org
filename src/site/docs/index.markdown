# {{ page.title }}

This overview of Dart development
points you to docs, articles, and other resources
to help you as you create, test, and deploy Dart code.

## Getting started

Read these,
or just [download Dart](/#get-started)
and start playing with Dart Editor.

[Try Dart](/codelabs/darrrt/)
: Walks you through building a web app.
This one-hour code lab assumes you have some programming experience
but no previous experience with either Dart or web apps.

[Language Tour (_Dart: Up and Running_, Chapter 2)](/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch02.html)
: Shows each major Dart language feature, from variables to
operators to classes and libraries.

[Dart Tutorials](/docs/tutorials/)
: Your step-by-step guide to building web apps using Dart.

## Concepts

You don't need to follow all of these links right now,
but remember them for the future.


### Libraries

The Dart download includes several libraries.
You can also define your own libraries
and get many more using the
[pub package manager](http://pub.dartlang.org).

[Libraries and Visibility (a section of _Dart: Up and Running_, Chapter 2)](/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch02.html#libraries)
: Learn how to use and create libraries.

[Library Tour (_Dart: Up and Running_, Chapter 3)](/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch03.html)
: Learn how to use the major features in each library that comes with Dart.

[Articles](/articles/)
: Look in the "Libraries and APIs" section
for help using individual packages, libraries, and APIs such as
[polymer.dart](/polymer-dart/),
[unittest](/articles/dart-unit-tests/),
and [Futures](/articles/using-future-based-apis/).

[API Reference](http://api.dartlang.org)
: Browse the full API reference docs for the Dart libraries.


### Fundamental classes

Many Dart methods return Iterable, Future, or Stream objects.


#### Iterable

An Iterable object is a collection of objects,
such as a list or set.
Closely tied to the Dart language,
the Iterable class provides the interface used by for-in loops.
Learn more:

* [Collections (a section of _Dart: Up and Running_, Chapter 3)](/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch03.html#ch03-collections)
* [Iteration (a section of _Dart: Up and Running_, Chapter 3)](/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch03.html#ch03-iteration)
* [Iterable API documentation](http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/Iterable.html)


#### Future

A Future object represents a value to be delivered in the future.
For example, the dart:io File class's readAsString() method
returns a Future&lt;String>,
which you can use to get the file's entire contents as a string.
Learn more:

* [Using Future Based APIs](/articles/using-future-based-apis/)
* [Futures and Error Handling](/articles/futures-and-error-handling/)
* [Future API documentation](http://api.dartlang.org/dart_async/Future.html)


#### Stream

A Stream object represents a sequence of data
to be delivered in the future.
One example of a stream is the onClick stream of events
for a dart:html button.
Another example is the file content stream returned by
the dart:io File class's openRead() method.

* [Use Streams for Data](/docs/tutorials/streams/)
* [Creating Streams in Dart](/articles/creating-streams/)
* [Stream API documentation](http://api.dartlang.org/dart_async/Stream.html)

## Creating command-line apps

You can use Dart for anything from scripts to web servers.
Thanks to Heroku's support for third-party runtimes,
you can run your server-side Dart app on Heroku's cloud.

[Writing Command-Line Apps: A Programmer's Guide](serverguide.html)
: Provides a set of samples, tutorials, and articles that
explain the APIs, tools, and techniques for writing and
deploying command-line apps such as servers and scripts.

## Creating web apps

If you're new to web apps,
start with the <a href="/docs/tutorials/">Dart Tutorials</a>&mdash;a
set of tutorials that teach you how to use Dart to write web apps,
assuming no previous experience with either Dart or web apps.

While you're developing your web app,
you can run it in Dartium.
Later, you can compile your app to JavaScript
and run it in other browsers.

When creating web apps, you can use
dart:html and the polymer.dart package
or AngularDart.
Although you don't need to use polymer.dart or AngularDart,
they're a great way to simplify your code.


### dart:html

A basic, yet Darty, interface to the browser.

* [Connect Dart &amp; HTML](/docs/tutorials/connect-dart-html/)
  (part of the Dart tutorials)
* [Improving the DOM](/articles/improving-the-dom/)
* [dart:html API documentation](http://api.dartlang.org/dart_html.html)

### Polymer.dart

A package that lets you use tomorrow's web APIs today.

* [Polymer.dart homepage](/polymer-dart/)
* [pub.dartlang.org/packages/polymer](http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/polymer)
* [Samples that use polymer.dart](/samples/#polymer_dart)

### AngularDart

A port of the Angular framework to Dart.

* [AngularDart tutorial](https://github.com/angular/angular.dart.tutorial/wiki)
* [pub.dartlang.org/packages/angular](http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/angular)
* [Samples that use AngularDart](/samples/#angular_dart)

### Dart and JavaScript

You aren't limited to Dart libraries.
With the dart:js library,
you can use JavaScript libraries in your Dart app.

* [dart:js API documentation](http://api.dartlang.org/dart_js.html)
* [Samples that use JavaScript](/samples/#using_javascript_from_dart)

## Tools

Thanks to Dart's tool friendliness,
you have many choices for editors, IDEs, and other tools.


When you [download Dart](/#get-started),
you get not only [Dart Editor](/tools/editor/), but also
[Dartium](/tools/dartium/) (a browser with built-in Dart support)
and the [Dart SDK](/tools/sdk/).
The SDK includes command-line tools such as
the Dart VM (dart), a Dart-to-JavaScript compiler (dart2js),
and a package manager (pub).

[Dart Editor](/tools/editor/)
: The easiest way to start writing Dart programs.

[Tools for Dart](/tools/)
: Information about tools,
plus links to downloads.

## Testing

A static analyzer and unit testing library
provide support for testing your web or command-line app.
If your code is open source,
try drone.io for continuous testing.

* [dartanalyzer: The Static Analyzer](/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch04-tools-dart_analyzer.html)
* [Writing Unit Tests for Pub Packages](/articles/writing-unit-tests-for-pub-packages/)
* [Unit Testing with Dart](/articles/dart-unit-tests/)
* [drone.io](http://drone.io)

try these resources.


### Programming questions

Ask specific programming questions here:

* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dart)


### Style

Whenever possible, follow the practices
recommended in these documents:

* [Idiomatic Dart](/articles/idiomatic-dart/)
* [Dart Style Guide](/articles/style-guide/)
* [Guidelines for Dart Doc Comments](/articles/doc-comment-guidelines/)

### Issues and feature requests

If you think you've found a bug,
check the list of Dart issues to see whether
the problem has already been reported
and has a workaround.

To request a feature, you can create an issue
or start a discussion on the appropriate
[mailing list](/support/).
