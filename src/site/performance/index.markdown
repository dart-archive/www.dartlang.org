## Frequently asked questions 

What does the benchmark score mean?
: The score is essentially runs/second: the number of times
  you can run the benchmark in one second. For all scores,
  bigger is better.

What benchmarks are you tracking?
: For a start, we are showing charts for the
  [Octane](https://developers.google.com/octane/) benchmarks Richards and
  DeltaBlue.
  [Richards](https://github.com/dart-lang/benchmark_harness/blob/master/example/Richards.dart)
  is an OS kernel simulation benchmark, originally written
  in BCPL by Martin Richards. The main focus in Richards is on property
  access and calling functions and methods.
  [DeltaBlue](https://github.com/dart-lang/benchmark_harness/blob/master/example/DeltaBlue.dart)
  is a one-way constraint solver, originally written in Smalltalk by
  John Maloney and Mario Wolczko. The main focus in DeltaBlue is on
  polymorphism and object-oriented programming.

How do you generate numbers for the Dart VM, dart2js, and V8?
: The Dart VM numbers are generated using the Dart
  [benchmark harness](https://github.com/dart-lang/benchmark_harness) on the
  Dart VM. Similarly, the dart2js numbers are generated by compiling the
  benchmarks and harness to JavaScript
  and then running the generated code in V8.
  Finally, the V8 numbers are generated using the same benchmarks written in
  JavaScript and with exactly the same harness rewritten in JavaScript.

What system setup are you running the benchmarks on?
: The benchmarks are run on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2400 CPU @ 3.10GHz
  processor running the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS x64 operating system.

Are the results 32-bit or 64-bit?
: They are 32-bit. While the code runs on a 64-bit operating system, we’re
  running the 32-bit version of both the V8 and Dart VMs.
