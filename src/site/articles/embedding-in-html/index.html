<h1> Embedding Dart in HTML </h1>

<p>
Dart is a new structured programming language for the browser.
Like JavaScript, Dart programs can be directly embedded on HTML pages
served to the browser.
</p>

<p>
This document describes syntax and semantics
for how Dart is embedded in a web page.
An HTML page with Dart can be translated to
a semantically equivalent page embedding JavaScript.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2> Dart MIME type </h2>

<p>
HTML <code>script</code> tags provide a
<code>type</code> attribute to define the language of the script.
For Dart, this attribute has the value 'application/dart'.
</p>

<p>
Like other script tags,
the script contents can be
inlined as the body of the <code>script</code> tag
or specified by reference via a URL using
the <code>script</code> tag&rsquo;s <code>src</code> attribute.
</p>

<p>
The Dart script must have a visible top-level function called <code>main()</code>,
either declared directly in the script or in a sourced/imported file.
The browser will invoke <code>main()</code>
when the page is loaded.
</p>

<p>
The Dart script may have optional
<code>#source</code> and <code>#import</code> directives. 
Dart scripts include other scripts using the <code>#source</code> directive. 
Dart scripts can use other libraries with the <code>#import</code> directive.
</p>

<h2>Fundamental differences from JavaScript</h2>

<p>
Embedding Dart code is different from embedding JavaScript
in a few ways.
</p>


<section>
<h3>Isolated script tags</h3>

<p>
Every HTML page can have multiple Dart script tags,
but each Dart script tag in a page runs in isolation.
This fundamentally differs from the way
that JavaScript is embedded in HTML&mdash;in
JavaScript, declarations across multiple script tags are
combined together in the same namespace.
In Dart, code in one script tag cannot directly access code defined in another.
If a script wishes to load code from a different URL,
it must do so via <code>#source</code> or <code>#import</code>.
Each script tag must define its own <code>main()</code> entry point
in order to run.
</p>
</section>


<section>
<h3>Delayed execution</h3>

<p>
Unlike in JavaScript,
top-level Dart constructs (such as interfaces, classes, and functions)
are declarative.
Each Dart application (defined via a script tag)
provides an explicit <code>main()</code> entry point
that is invoked by the browser when it is ready to run.
</p>

<p>
By default, each Dart script tag&rsquo;s <code>main()</code>
is invoked on the DOMContentLoaded event.
Ordering across script tags is not guaranteed.
This has a few consequences:
</p>

<ol>
  <li> All script tags with the 'application/dart' MIME type in the page
    can be loaded asynchronously/concurrently.
    (That is, HTML5 async and defer tags are hints
    that do not affect semantics.)
  </li>
  <li> Dart code executes only after the page is parsed.
    Dart programmers can assume that the DOM is fully loaded.
  </li>
</ol>

<aside>
  <div class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    We are considering allowing Dart code to run as soon as a script is loaded
    (for example, like JavaScript with HTML5 async attributes).
    This would allow running a script before the DOM is fully loaded,
    but we would still preserve the asynchronous semantics we support today.
  </div>
</aside>
</section>


<section>
<h3> No inline event listeners </h3>

<p>
We disallow inline event listeners of the form:
</p>

{% highlight html %}<div onclick="foo()">Click this text.</div>{% endhighlight %}

<p>
With JavaScript, programmers can embed inline event listener code
directly onto HTML nodes.
However, this is typically discouraged in modern JavaScript applications.
HTML pages generally render more quickly
if listeners are added programmatically afterwards.
Modern security guidelines also discourage inline code.
As such, we propose to not allow inline Dart listeners.

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>
Here is a simple Hello World in HTML using Dart.
This script defines its own isolate/library.
The <code>main()</code> method is implicitly the entry point.  
</p>

{% highlight html %}
<html>
  <body>
    <script type='application/dart'>
      void main() {
        HTMLElement element = document.getElementById('message');
        element.innerHTML = 'Hello from Dart';
      }
    </script>
    <div id='message'></div>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The div element above is guaranteed to exist
by the time the Dart code starts running.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to the previous example, the following is an error:
</p>
{% highlight html %}
<html>
  <body>
    <script type='application/dart'>
      void hello(String text) {
        HTMLElement element = document.getElementById('message');
        element.innerHTML = text;
      } // This tag triggers a warning as no main() is defined.
    </script>
    <script type="application/dart">
      void main() {
        hello('Hello from Dart'); // hello() will not resolve.
      }
    </script>
    <div id="message"></div>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Each Dart script in the page runs in its own isolate,
  and exactly one <code>main()</code> should exist per script.
</p>

<p>
To incorporate external code,
use a <code>#source</code> or <code>#import</code> directive instead.
For example, suppose the file <code>Hello.dart</code>
defines the <code>hello()</code> method shown above.
Then the following executes as expected:
</p>

{% highlight html %}
<html>
  <body>
    <script type='application/dart'>
      #source(Hello.dart)
      void main() {
        hello('Hello from Dart');
      }
    </script>
    <div id="message"></div>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}
