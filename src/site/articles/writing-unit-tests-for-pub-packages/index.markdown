## Introduction

This article shows you how to create a really simple Dart
package. Because we would never want to write a package without testing
the code in it, this article also introduces you to the excellent unittest library.

[Pub](http://pub.dartlang.org/) is Dart's package mananger. After working 
through this post, you will be able to bundle your Dart libraries and share
them with others on pub.dartlang.org.

For the purposes of this post, our basic package consists of
a single `range()` function modeled roughly on the Python builtin function with
the same name.  

`range()` has the following signature: 

{% prettify dart %}
List<num> range(num start, num stop, [num step = 1]);
{% endprettify %}

It returns a list of ints between `start` and `stop` separated by `step`
steps. Here is some sample usage:

{% prettify dart %}
range(0, 4);    // [0, 1, 2, 3]
range(1, 6, 2); // [1, 3, 5]
{% endprettify %}

Let's get started.

## Create a simple package

Open up Dart Editor, and create a new application called **range**. This new 
application is not a web project, so uncheck **Generate content for a
basic web app**.  But do make sure that **Add Pub support** is checked.  

![Creating a new non-web Dart application](imgs/creating_a_dart_app.jpg)

Delete the automatically created `bin` directory. You don't need it.

Create a top-level `lib` directory. Inside `lib`, create a `range.dart` file;
the code for `range()` goes in here. (We'll get rid of the automatically 
created `class Range {}` code when we define our `range()` function.)

We should create other directories and files, as well—a
LICENSE, a `doc` directory for documentation, an `example` directory with examples 
showing usage of our package, and so on—but our focus here is on how to write
unit tests, so we'll skip over those files and directories for now. To know
what else we should be doing to make this a _respectable_ package, see the
excellent writeup of
[package layout conventions](http://pub.dartlang.org/doc/package-layout.html).

## Add the unittest package to your library

With the basic files created for our package, let's open up `pubspec.yaml` 
and add some metadata for our pub package, following the
[pubspec format](http://pub.dartlang.org/doc/pubspec.html).
Every package **must** contain a `pubspec.yaml`; in fact, it is this file
that makes it a package. 

Add a simple description for the package and specify its only dependency,
the unittest package. Your `pubspec.yaml` should look like this:

{% prettify dart %}
name: range
description: An approximate implementation of the Python range() function.
    
dependencies:
  unittest: any
{% endprettify %}

Saving `pubspec.yaml` in Dart Editor automatically triggers a call to 
`pub get`; this creates a `pubspec.lock` file and a bunch of symlinks
that are necessary for the plumbing to work correctly. Fortunately, 
`pub` handles all these details for us. 

## Write some code

Let's create a bare-bones implementation for `range()`. Your `lib/range.dart`
should look like this:
    
{% prettify dart %}
library range; 

List<int> range(int start, int stop, [int step=1]) {
  if (start >= stop) {
    throw new ArgumentError("start must be less than stop");
  }

  List<int> list = [];
  
  for (var i = start; i < stop; i+= step) {
    list.add(i);
  }

  return list;
}
{% endprettify %}
    
## Write some tests

Create a top-level `test` directory. Inside `test`, create a `range_test.dart`
file; our tests go in here. Remove the `class RangeTest {}` code from this file.
We won't be needing it for this simple example.

Before we can run our tests, `test/range_test.dart` needs access to the 
`unittest` package and the `range` library. At the top of `range_test.dart`, 
add these import statements:

{% prettify dart %}
import 'package:unittest/unittest.dart';
import 'package:range/range.dart';
{% endprettify %}

Now add a couple of tests. (We'll need many more to really test `range()`, but
these are a good start.) Your `range_test.dart` should look like this:

{% prettify dart %}
import 'package:unittest/unittest.dart';
import 'package:range/range.dart';

void main() {
  test("range() produces a list that starts at start", () {
    expect(range(0, 4)[0], equals(0));
  });

  test("range() throws an exception when start > stop", () {
    expect(() => range(5, 2), throwsA(new isInstanceOf<ArgumentError>()));
  });      
}
{% endprettify %}

An individual test goes inside `test()`. The `expect()` function
evaluates the equality
between the expected and actual values. A string argument to `test()` describes
the purpose of the test. 

If you run the tests now and get an error because Dart Editor cannot locate the
unittest library, try running `pub update`. (You can find it in Dart Editor's
**Tools** menu.) You should see the following output
in Dart Editor:

{% prettify none %}
Running pub update ...
Resolving dependencies...
Dependencies updated!
{% endprettify %}

After running `pub update`, you should see a newly created `packages` symlink 
in the `test` directory that gives your tests access to the unittest
library. (`pub update` recursively creates symlinks in every subdirectory of 
`/test`, `/web`, and `/bin`; it does _not_ create symlinks in `lib`.)

Now run the tests by pressing the green arrow in Dart Editor, or pressing 
**Cmd+R** on a Mac, or typing `dart test/range_test.dart` on the
command line. You should see the following output:

{% prettify none %}
unittest-suite-wait-for-done
PASS: range() produces a list that starts at start
PASS: range() throws an exception when start > stop

All 2 tests passed.
unittest-suite-success
{% endprettify %}

We've made good progress, but our test coverage is still pretty limited. Let's
add a few more tests and group them in a way that makes our testing strategy
clear. Change `range_test.dart` so it looks like this:

{% prettify dart %}
import 'package:unittest/unittest.dart';
import 'package:range/range.dart';

void main() {
  group("range()", () {
    group("produces a list that", () {
      test("starts at start", () {
        expect(range(0, 4)[0], equals(0));
      });

      test ("stops before stop", () {
        expect(range(0, 4).last, equals(3));
      });

      test("has consecutive values if no step is given", () {
        expect(range(1, 6), equals([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]));
      });

      test("has non-consecutive values with step > 1", () {
        expect(range(1, 6, 2), equals([1, 3, 5]));
      });
    });

    group("throws an exception when", () {
      test("start > stop", () {
        expect(() => range(5, 2), throwsA(new isInstanceOf<ArgumentError>()));
      });

      test("start == stop", () {
        expect(() => range(5, 5), throwsA(new isInstanceOf<ArgumentError>()));
      });
    });
  });
}
{% endprettify %}

Much better. We use nested calls to `group()` to organize our tests, and we pass
descriptive string args to each `group()` call to indicate our intent. If
you run the tests again, you should see:

{% prettify none %}
unittest-suite-wait-for-done
PASS: range() produces a list that starts at start
PASS: range() produces a list that stops before stop
PASS: range() produces a list that has consecutive values if no step is given
PASS: range() produces a list that has non-consecutive values with step > 1
PASS: range() throws an exception when start > stop
PASS: range() throws an exception when start == stop

All 6 tests passed.
unittest-suite-success
{% endprettify %}

## Summary

We created a minimal Dart package, made it (barely) good enough
to put on pub.dartlang.org, and wrote a few tests.  This is a good start, of course, but
we have only scratched the surface of how we should test our packages. For a
very thorough explanation of how the unittest framework works in Dart, I 
highly recommend a careful reading of 
[Unit Testing with Dart](/articles/dart-unit-tests/) by 
Graham Wheeler. He goes into considerable detail about writing tests, defining
`setUp()` and `tearDown()`, running asynchronous tests, using and creating
matchers, and configuring your test environment.
