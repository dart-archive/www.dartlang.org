README --- General notes about editing this file:

* This file is processed by liquid, which evaluates {{ var }} and removes the
\{\{ and \}\} symbols from the code. Because we use \{\{\}\} in our template
expressions, we need to escape them in a special way. Unfortunately using
\{\{\}\} within code makes the backslash show up. There are 2 ways to work
around this:
  * Doing {{'{{'}}: liquid evaluates it as a string expression returning \{\{.
  * Using \{\% raw \%\} blocks.

* the codesample blocks are an extension added to jekyll written as 'liquid'
blocks. The meaning of a block like this:
  \{\% codesample 80 \%\}

  text
  \{\% sample 10 20 url \%\}
  \{\% endcodesample \%\}
is that we'll create a table, the first column will have sample source code (in
this case "text"). This code can have a \{\% highlight \%\} section, but other
than that, no markdown is supported here :(. The column width is specified as
the first argument of the codesample tag above it (in this example 80 means
80%). The \{\% sample \%\} tag defines the width, height, and url for an iframe
that will contain the running version of the code sample.

Dart web components provide templates, data binding, and encapsulation, to
help you write web applications at scale. An early version is available in the
[dart-web-components project][dwc].

Many UI frameworks exist for writing web apps in JavaScript&mdash;for example
[Backbone.js][backbone], [Ember.js][ember], and [AngularJS][angular].  Recently, the web
community has been pushing to include some of the common ideas of these
frameworks directly into the browser platform.  As a result, browsers have added
features like [shadow DOM][sd] and [web components][wc], and other experimental
and cool ideas have been proposed, such as [model-driven views][mdv] (MDV).

Dart web components combine the ideas of web components and MDV, adapting them
to work well with Dart.  Dart web components take advantage of advanced browser
features when possible, emulating missing features when necessary.

This article walks through some examples that illustrate how to write and use
Dart web components. We have a separate article with instructions for using the
[Dart web component tools](tools.html), and we soon plan to publish an
additional document with a detailed specification.

## MDV templates in Dart {#templates}

Most UI frameworks provide templates to specify views with a succinct
declarative syntax. Dart web components closely follow the MDV syntax, which is
basically HTML with small extensions to enable the following features:

  * **One-way data binding**: Embed data into your UI
  * **Two-way data binding**: Keep data in sync with UI changes
  * **Conditionals**: Selectively show parts of the UI
  * **Loops**: Construct lists and tables by iterating over collections
  * **Event listeners**: Easily attach code that reacts to UI events

We made some changes to ensure that using Dart with MDV feels natural, but
otherwise all the concepts from MDV are available here.  Let's take a look at
examples for each of these features.

### One-way data binding {#one-way-binding}

You can inject data in your template using `{{'{{'}}expression}}`.  The
example below shows a simple hello world program where the value of the Dart
top-level variable `dataValue` is injected in the page automatically. The right
column shows the app generated from this code running in an iframe.

{% codesample 90 %}
{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<html><body>
  <div>Hello {{dataValue}}!</div>
  <script type="application/dart">
    String dataValue;
    main() {
      var today = new Date.now();
      dataValue = 'world ${today.year}-${today.month}-${today.day}';
    }
  </script>
</body></html>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% source helloworld.html %}
{% iframe 300px 200px _helloworld.html.html %}
{% endcodesample %}

The template expression above is a **one-way data
binding**. It sets up automatic monitoring of the data,
and ensures that the UI stays up-to-date when the data's value changes.

Dart web components implement this monitoring
by using the [watcher.dart][watcher] library
(included with the Dart web components package).
You can directly invoke this library if necessary.
For example, the following code invokes [watchers.dispatch()][watcher.dispatch]
to make a change visible to the UI. 

{% codesample 90 %}
{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<html><body>
  <div>Hello counter: {{count}}</div>
  <script type="application/dart">
    import 'dart:html';
    import 'package:web_components/watcher.dart' as watchers;
    int count;
    main() {
      count = 0;
      window.setInterval(() {
        count++;
        watchers.dispatch(); 
      }, 1000);
    }
  </script>
</body></html>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% source counter.html %}
{% iframe 300px 200px _counter.html.html %}
{% endcodesample %}

Although every now and then it's useful to access watchers
directly, we don't usually have to manually write these
calls. In particular, Dart web components automatically make the dispatch
call when using common features such as two-way binding and attaching event
listeners.

### Two-way data binding {#two-way-binding}

Two-way data binding lets us define that we want a DOM element's value
(typically an input box or a check box) to be kept in sync with the value of a
Dart variable. The following example creates a two-way binding between `str` and
`input.value`. We declare this binding by writing the attribute
`data-bind="value:str"`.

{% codesample 90 %}
{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<html><body>
  <div>
    Input:
    <input type="text" data-bind="value:str" placeholder="type something here">
    <div> Value: {{str}}</div>
    <div> Length: {{str.length}}</div>
  </div>
  <script type="application/dart">
    String str = '';
    main() {}
  </script>
</body></html>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% source twoway.html %}
{% iframe 300px 200px _twoway.html.html %}
{% endcodesample %}

This is a simple example where Dart web components automatically dispatch
events for data-model changes. In particular, whenever you update the value of
the text box, the string and its length will be updated in other parts of the
UI.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>A note about expressions:</strong>

<p>We want to make Dart web components have, to a great extent, feature and design
parity with MDV. For this reason, we try to match the syntax of the MDV
template language. MDV restricts data-binding expressions to an expression
language containing variables, field dereferences, and array accesses. This
means that expressions in MDV templates are likely to be valid Dart and valid
JavaScript as well. It also means that advanced Dart expressions are not valid
within <code>{{'{{'}}expression}}</code>. However, you can always hide complex expressions
under a getter in Dart and use the getter property within the template.</p>

<p>A full specification of the expression syntax will be available soon. </p>
</div>
</aside>



### Conditionals {#conditionals}

Template conditionals allow you to selectively activate parts of the UI. Write
a conditional by wrapping a portion of the UI in a `<template>` tag and putting
the condition in an attribute that has the form `instantiate="if expr"`.  For
instance, the following example shows `They match!` only when both input boxes
have the same text:

{% codesample 90 %}
{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<html><body>
  <div>
    <div> Input1: <input type="text" data-bind="value:str1"></div>
    <div> Input2: <input type="text" data-bind="value:str2"></div>
    <template instantiate="if str1 == str2">
      <div>They match!</div>
    </template>
  </div>
  <script type="application/dart">
    String str1 = '';
    String str2 = '';
    main() {}
  </script>
</body></html>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% source matchstrings.html %}
{% iframe 300px 200px _matchstrings.html.html %}
{% endcodesample %}

### Loops {#loops}

Template loops allow iteration over Iterable Dart objects, such as Collections.
To create a loop that operates on each item in an Iterable object, use the `iterate`
attribute in a `<template>` tag.  The following example shows a fun little app
that has search as you type. It uses two-way data binding to store the
`query` string, and then computes a filtered set of results, which it displays
using a looping construct.

{% codesample 90 %}
{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<html><body>
  <div>
    <span>Search for something:</span>
    <input type="text" data-bind="value:query">
    <div>
      <template instantiate='if noMatches'><span>No matches</span></template>
      <template instantiate='if !noMatches'><span>Top results:</span></template>
    </div>
    <div><ul>
      <template iterate='fruit in results'>
        <li>{{fruit}}</li>
      </template>
    </ul></div>
  </div>
  <script type="application/dart">
    String query = '';
    List<String> fruits = const [ 'Apple', 'Apricot', 'Avocado',
        'Banana', 'Blackberry', 'Blackcurrant', 'Blueberry',
        'Currant', 'Cherry', 'Clementine', 'Date', 'Durian',
        'Fig', 'Gooseberry', 'Grape', 'Grapefruit', 'Guava',
        'Huckleberry', 'Kiwi', 'Lemon', 'Lime', 'Lychee',
        'Mandarine', 'Mango', 'Cantaloupe', 'Honeydew melon',
        'Nectarine', 'Orange', 'Peach', 'Pear', 'Plum',
        'Pineapple', 'Pomegranate', 'Raspberry', 'Redcurrant',
        'Star fruit', 'Strawberry', 'Tangerine', 'Tomato',
        'Watermelon'];

    List<String> get results {
      var res = fruits.filter(
          (v) => v.toLowerCase().contains(query.toLowerCase()));
      if (res.length > 20) { 
        res.length = 20;
        res.add('... and many more');
      }
      return res;
    }

    bool get noMatches => results.isEmpty();

    main() {}
  </script>
</body></html>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% source fruitsearch.html %}
{% iframe 300px 600px _fruitsearch.html.html %}
{% endcodesample %}


### Event listeners {#events}

Templates provide a succinct way to listen for arbitrary UI events and
associate those events with Dart code: `data-action`
attributes. Here is an example that listens for click events:

{% codesample 90 %}
{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<html><body>
  <div>
    <button data-action="click:increment">Click me</button>
    <span>(click count: {{count}})</span>
  </div>
  <script type="application/dart">
    int count = 0;
    void increment(e) { count++; }
    main() {}
  </script>
</body></html>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% source clickcount.html %}
{% iframe 300px 200px _clickcount.html.html %}
{% endcodesample %}


### Summary of templates {#template-summary}

Templates solve one part of the problem in building web applications: reducing
the amount of boilerplate code needed to set up a typical
model-view-viewmodel architecture. One-way data binding, two-way data binding,
and data-action listeners help reduce the need for manually creating controller
objects that do these bindings by hand. By combining bindings, conditionals,
and loops, you can create simple and sophisticated views in a
declarative fashion.

However, templating alone is not enough. We need mechanisms to encapsulate and
abstract views so we can scale to build larger web apps. This is were we need
web components. 

## Web components in Dart {#components}

Web components provide a way to create encapsulated reusable views, which are
useful for building medium and large applications. A web component includes a
view, some data, and behavior. With Dart web components, views are described in
terms of templates, while data and behavior are written directly in Dart.

### Declaring a component {#component-declaration}

Web components are declared using a special `<element>` tag. For example, we can
take the click-count example above and make it a component as follows:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<html><body>
  <element name="x-click-counter" constructor="CounterComponent" extends="div">
    <template>
      <div>
        <button data-action="click:increment">Click me</button>
        <span>(click count: {{count}})</span>
      </div>
    </template>
    <script type="application/dart">
      import 'package:web_components/web_component.dart';

      class CounterComponent extends WebComponent {
        int count = 0;
        void increment(e) { count++; }
      }
    </script>
  </element>
<!-- more below... -->
</body></html>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The `<element>` tag defines a component whose visual appearance is declared under
the child `<template>` tag, and whose behavior code is embedded or sourced by
the child `<script>` tag.

Components can be thought of as extending HTML elements. The `extends`
attribute of `<element>` indicates which HTML element the component extends
(for example, "div").
The `constructor` attribute indicates the class
that defines this component's behavior
(for example, "CounterComponent"). Today, this
class must be a subclass of `WebComponent`,
but in the future it will be possible to
use a subclass of the HTML element declared in the `extends`
attribute. In the preceding example, that would mean
`class CounterComponent extends DivElement ...`.

The `<element>` tag declares the component's name with the `name`
attribute. Later, this name is used to instantiate the component.

### Instantiating a component {#component-instantiation}

Instantiating a component can be done in two ways: by using its name as a tag
(for example, `<x-click-counter></x-click-counter>`)
or by setting the `is` attribute on the
tag that the component extends from,
as in the following example.

{% codesample 90 %}
{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<html><body>
  <!-- ... element declared as above -->
  <div is="x-click-counter"></div>
  <script type="application/dart">
    main(){}
  </script>
</body></html>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% source countcomponent.html %}
{% iframe 300px 200px _countcomponent.html.html %}
{% endcodesample %}


### Passing data to a component {#pass-data-to-component}

All of the public fields in a component declaration can be initialized directly
when we instantiate a component. We can do this by writing a special
`data-value` attribute in the HTML. For instance, the following example
instantiates two click-counter components (declared just like above), but
initializes the `count` field of the component to a different value each time.

{% codesample 90 %}
{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<html><body>
  <!-- ... element declared as above -->
  <div is="x-click-counter" data-value="count: myNumber"></div>
  <div is="x-click-counter" data-value="count: 5"></div>
  <script type="application/dart">
    int myNumber = 12;
    main(){}
  </script>
</body></html>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% source countcomponent5.html %}
{% iframe 300px 200px _countcomponent5.html.html %}
{% endcodesample %}

### Importing a component {#import-components}

When developing larger web applications, it is really useful to be able to split
the work and divide pieces of your application in multiple files. It is also
useful to create reusable components that you embed in several places of your
application or even across several applications.

Web components allows us to import other components using `<link
rel="components">` tags. For example, suppose we created a file
`clickcounter.html` that contains the declaration of the click-counter component
as we had above. Then the preceding example could be rewritten as follows:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="components" href="clickcounter.html">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div is="x-click-counter" data-value="count: myNumber"></div>
    <div is="x-click-counter" data-value="count: 5"></div>
    <script type="application/dart">
      int myNumber = 12;
      main(){}
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

## Upcoming features {#next-steps}

We are still adding features and making changes to Dart web components. Here are
some of the features we are working on:

  * Support for subcomponents. Using a special `<content>` tag, a component
    can embed nodes that will be provided when instantiating it. For instance,
    you could write a component that puts a frame around an image as follows:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<html>
  <body>
    <element name="x-myframe">
      <template>
        <!-- some complex wrapping happens here ... -->
        <div class="framestyle">...<content></content>...</div>
      </template>
    </element>

    <div is="x-myframe">
      <!-- img will be included where we wrote <content> above -->
      <img src="...">
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

  * Alternative MDV conditional and listing constructs. Instead of using
    `<template>` tags, you will be able to use `instantiate` and
    `iterate` attributes directly on any element. This is important because
    `<template>` tags aren't valid in all parts of the HTML. For example,
    this feature will make it possible to iterate on table rows and cells.

## Tools for using Dart web components {#tools}

Several tools will help you create and deploy
projects that use Dart web components. A compiler tool can be run
offline to generate efficient code for your components. The generated code will
try to use the native features available in browsers, but otherwise it will
resort to other techniques to ensure that the semantics of Dart web components
are the same everywhere.

Both Dartium and Dart Editor will have support for Dart web components,
providing you with a smooth edit/refresh cycle.
In Dart Editor, changes to HTML and Dart source files
can be compiled automatically in the background.
An extension for Dartium will compile components on the fly as
you load them.

For more details about these tools, see [Tools for Dart Web
Components](tools.html).
