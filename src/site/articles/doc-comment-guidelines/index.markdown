This document describes the conventions the Dart team
has agreed upon for documentation comments.
If you have suggestions for improving the conventions,
[let us know](http://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org).

## Examples

Here's a typical comment for a function or method:

<!-- BEGIN(min) -->{% prettify dart %}
/**
 * Returns the lesser of two numbers.
 *
 * Returns NaN if either argument is NaN.
 * The lesser of -0.0 and 0.0 is -0.0.
 * If the arguments are otherwise equal (including int and doubles with the
 * same mathematical value) then it is unspecified which of the two arguments
 * is returned.
 *
 *     return min(100, value);
 */
num min(num a, num b) {/*...*/}
{% endprettify %}<!-- END(min) -->

And one for a variable or property:

<!-- BEGIN(PI) -->{% prettify dart %}
/// The PI constant.
const double PI = 3.1415926535897932;
{% endprettify %}<!-- END(PI) -->

For an example of a class description with example code, see Completer
([generated doc](http://api.dartlang.org/docs/bleeding_edge/dart_core/Completer.html),
[source code](http://code.google.com/p/dart/source/browse/branches/bleeding_edge/dart/sdk/lib/core/future.dart)).


## Content

The first paragraph of a doc comment is special.
After that, the content is up to you,
although we strongly recommend including code samples.


### First paragraph: a "one-sentence" description

As the examples at the top of this document show,
the first paragraph of any doc comment
is a brief, user-oriented description ending with a period.
It is not a complete sentence.

The description should help the reader understand
whether this bit of API might be useful to them,
compared to similar sounding API.
Never just repeat the API name;
try to restate it to give more information
than the name alone provides.
Avoid links when possible.


#### Functions and methods 

Function/method descriptions begin with a **third-person verb**.

Examples:

* `Returns true if every element of this collection satisfies the predicate [f]. `
* `Starts the stopwatch.`


#### Variables, getters, and setters

Static/instance variable and getter/setter descriptions are **noun phrases**.

If there’s both a setter and a getter, comment only the getter.
That way, it’ll be treated as a variable.
Don’t include the type, since that’s already in the signature.

Example:

* `The number of days in the current month.`


#### Classes

Class descriptions are **noun phrases**.

Examples:

* Possible description for [List](http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/List.html): <br>`An indexable collection with a length, also known as an array.`

* Possible description for [String](http://api.dartlang.org/dart_core/String.html): <br>`A basic string, implemented as an immutable sequence of UTF-16 code units.`  
        

### The rest of the doc comment

Subsequent paragraphs explain return values,
what arguments you can specify, side effects,
exceptions that users might want to catch, related APIs, and so on.   

Be sure to provide **code examples** for the most common uses of the API,
and **links** to documents that provide more information.


## Markup

Format your text using the markup
specified in section 15.1.2 of the
[Dart Language Specification](/docs/spec/).
Although dartdoc currently recognizes some additional markdown
(as noted below),
it might not always.

**When in doubt, format less.**
You'll be less likely to break the docs, and someone else can always add formatting.


### Links

You can link to Dart identifiers,
of which constructors are a special case,
or to any URI you choose.

#### Identifier

`[id]` _or_ `[id](uri)`

If _id_ is the name of a class, the generated link points at the class,
even if the class has a constructor of the same name.
If you specify _uri_, it must be the URI of a dart library _L_,
and _id_ must a name declared in the exported namespace of _L_.  

#### Constructor

`[new c]` _or_ `[new c](uri)`


#### Hyperlink

`[text](uri)` _or_ `<uri>`

Note: _uri_ is the URI to link to;
_text_ is the string to be displayed instead of the URI.


### Block styles

#### Paragraph

Use _a blank line_ to denote the end of a paragraph.

#### Code block

Use four blank spaces _after the line's comment characters,_
which means **five spaces** after the * or /
(since they're always followed by a space).
Example:

{% prettify dart %}
/**
 * ...
 * For example:
 *
 *     Future&lt;int> future = getFutureFromSomewhere();
 *     future.then((value) {
 *       print("I received the number $value");
 *     });
 * ...
 */
{% endprettify %}

#### Header

<pre>## header text until newline</pre>

Lower level heads (such as `###`)
are currently implemented but not specified.


#### Bulleted (unordered) list item

<pre>* item continues until next list item or blank line</pre>

The line before the first bulleted list item must be blank.


#### Numbered (ordered) list item
<pre>1. item continues until next list item or blank line
2. next item</pre>

The specification states that items aren't autonumbered.
Use `2.` for item #2, `3.` for item #3, and so on.


### Inline styles

#### Code font

<code>`code`</code> _(note the backquotes)
or_
<code>[:code:]</code>

Avoid code font unless it’s (1) a big chunk of code or
(2) necessary to prevent confusion.

#### Italics

`_single underscore_`
_or_
`*single asterisk*`

It's possible that when the specification is clarified,
a single asterisk will mean boldface.

#### Boldface

`**double asterisk**`
_or_
`__double underscore__`

The specification doesn't include double asterisk and underscore,
and it's possible that a single asterisk will mean boldface.

Here's an example of a warning:

{% prettify dart %}
/**
 * ...
 * **Warning:** This feature is not yet supported in all modern browsers.
 * See <http://caniuse.com/flexbox> for current status.
 * ...
 */
{% endprettify %}


## Word choice, punctuation, and so on

* Keep it short, direct, and clear. This doc is for users, not implementers.
* Avoid abbreviations such as “i.e.” and “e.g.” (Many people don’t know what they mean.) Just say “that is” and “for example” if necessary.
* Use single quotes (') instead of double quotes (") in code samples
  unless you have a reason to do the opposite.
  (Just be consistent.)
* Use "this" instead of "the"
  when referring to an object created from the current class.
  Example:
  Adds an item to this list.
