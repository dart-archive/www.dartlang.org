##Profiling 101

When profiling your application you are determining how much memory or CPU time
it is using. This article will focus on the latter. The goal of CPU profiling is
to help identify specifically where your application is spending CPU time. In
order to do that you must determine how long a function or block of code takes
to execute. This act of measuring code execution time is the fundamental
technique.

###Narrowing in

Profiling is an act of binary search. You start off by timing a large block of
code—for example, your entire update loop—and then narrow in on the slowest
part. Eventually you have identified a set of functions or an algorithm that is
worth optimizing in order to increase your entire application's performance.

###Benchmarking

Programmers often create benchmarks which exercise an important algorithm in a
larger application. The point of the benchmark is to have an easy to run,
reproducible stress test of the performance sensitive algorithm. As the
implementation of the algorithm is being optimized the benchmark is run after
each change, verifying that the change did indeed make the algorithm run faster.

##Profiling Dart

Dart can go really fast, but you have to give the VM time to optimize your code.
Most benchmarks we've seen are short and to the point—so short that they don’t
trigger the VM’s optimizer. This isn’t an issue with real-world applications,
which execute long enough to be optimized. Read on to find out how to correctly
set up a Dart benchmark.

###Performing warm-ups

The Dart VM is designed to start running your application code immediately with
minimal startup time. In order to achieve this goal, code optimization is
delayed until a function becomes "hot". Code becomes hot when it has been run
numerous times.

To correctly benchmark Dart, you need to let Dart warm up. For Dart a warm-up is
a simple for loop:

{% highlight dart %}
// Warm-up
for (int i = 0; i < 2000; i++) {
    benchmarkCode();
}
{% endhighlight %}

After the warm-up the function is optimized. Now it’s time to measure the
performance:

{% highlight dart %}
var stopwatch = new Stopwatch();
stopwatch.start(); //Start timer.
benchmarkCode();
stopwatch.stop(); // Stop timer.
var elapsed = stopwatch.elapsedInUs(); // Get the microseconds.
{% endhighlight %}

The above code uses Dart’s
[Stopwatch](http://api.dartlang.org/docs/bleeding_edge/dart_core/Stopwatch.html)
class, which measures time with high precision and low overhead—exactly what you
need when profiling.

###Run in production mode with debugging disabled

The Dart VM can run in two modes: checked and production mode. Checked mode is
slower because the VM is checking types at runtime. Before benchmarking make
sure that your code runs without issue in checked mode. If checked mode finds an
issue, it will likely cause a performance drop in production mode. After making
sure your program is correct, you should run your benchmark in production mode
to get an accurate measurement of real world performance.

When executing from the command line checked mode is off by default and can be
turned on by passing the `--checked` command line flag. The editor has checked
mode on by default but can be turned off by going to the ‘Manage Launches’
window. It's important to **disable debugging** as well because that also has an
impact on run-time performance.

##Summary

When profiling your application be sure to follow these three rules:

1. Perform a warm-up before measuring code performance.
1. Ensure the code does not raise any errors when run in checked mode.
1. Run your benchmark in production mode with debugging disabled.

If you follow these rules you will be able to accurately measure how fast your
code runs. Once you've sped up your application, share your secrets on the

Happy profiling!
