Dart's [Web UI] package offers live, two-way data binding implemented with an
efficient observable engine. The new observable system propagates changes
proportional to the number of changes, instead of the number of watched
expressions. This results in less work per event loop and more responsive web
UIs.

This article covers Web UI's observables and how to use them with interactive
web apps. To learn more about Web UI, try our [tutorials][tutorial]
or [articles][web ui].

<aside class="alert alert-info">
<b>Head's up!</b> The observable system described in this article is intended
to replace the watchers system. Both systems work with Web UI today, but we
recommend migrating to observables as soon as possible. The watchers system
will be removed from Web UI in the future.

## Overview of data binding in Web UI
{: #data-binding-overview}

Web UI helps you efficiently bind application data to HTML, and vice versa, with
observables and observers. Observables are variables, fields, or collections
that can be observed for changes. Observers are functions that run when an
observable changes.

When an observable and and observer are connected, they are bound. For example,
an HTML input field can be bound to some application data. There are two kinds
of bindings with Web UI: one-way and two-way. A one-way binding updates some
HTML text when application data changes. A two-way binding joins an input field
to application data, such that whenever application data or field value changes,
the other side of the binding also changes.

![](binding-diagram.svg 'Two-way data binding between an object and an HTML field.')

Any variable, class field, class, setter, getter, or collection can be
observable. Use the @observable metadata annotation to tell Web UI "please
observe this, other things care when it changes." The Web UI  (dwc)
looks for @observable and generates the necessary boilerplate code to track the
changes for you.

### Efficiently tracking changes

Instead of asking every possible observable "Did you change?" on every event
loop over and over, Web UI has an efficient mechanism to notify only the right
observers at the right time. When data is read from or written to an observable,
Web UI stores a small record of the interaction. At the end of the event loop,
Web UI updates only the observers that correspond to each recorded interation.

## Observing variables

Web UI can observe a variable, and update HTML whenever the variable points to a
new object.

Here is a simple example of data binding between a top-level Dart variable and
inline HTML text. This example also includes declarative event binding.

{% prettify html %}
{% insert code/hello_world.html %}
{% endprettify %}

A variable wrapped with {% raw %}`{{` and `}}`{% endraw %} is observed, and its
object is converted to a string and inserted into the DOM. Any time the variable
is changed, the HTML is updated.

Here is the Dart code that supports this simple app:

{% prettify dart %}
{% insert code/hello_world.dart %}
{% endprettify %}


The superlative top-level variable is the same variable that is observed in the
HTML page with {% raw %}`{{ superlative }}`{% endraw %}. The `@observable`
metadata tells Web UI to observe this variable for changes.

Every time the button is clicked, the `changeIt()` function is run and the
superlative variable is pointed to a different string. Because superlative
changed, the HTML page changes, too. This is data binding in action!

### Live example
{: .no_toc}

<iframe width="500" height="150" src="code/out/hello_world.html"></iframe>

You don't have to write code to deal with propagating changes, finding HTML
elements, or updating HTML elements. All the of the mechanics for observing
changes and updating HTML is provided by Web UI.

This example shows how to observe a variable, but not actually the object a
variable points to. Read the next section to learn how to observe an object's
state.

## Observing classes

Web UI can also observe the internal state of objects. An observable variable
only signals when the variable points to another object, but an observable class
signals when any field on the object changes. This distinction is subtle but
very important.

Consider this example, which include a Person class. Here is a one-way binding
between the expression `person.name` and HTML:

{% prettify html %}
{% insert code/observe_object.html 9 11 %}
{% endprettify %}

Here is the corresponding Dart code:

{% prettify dart %}
{% insert code/observe_object.dart %}
{% endprettify %}

We don't need to observe the variable person because it always refers to the
same object (it is marked as final). We need to observe the Person class because
the name field changes. Therefore, @observable moved from the variable to the
class.

Marking a class as `@observable` is the same as marking all of its fields as
@observable. You can choose to mark individual fields, individual getters and
setters, or the entire class.

### Live example
{: .no_toc}

<iframe width="500" height="100" src="code/out/observe_object.html"></iframe>

## Observing collections

To observe a List, Map, Set, or Iterable, wrap it with `toObservable()`. A
change to the collection, such as an add, remove, or clear, is intercepted by
the observable wrapper and recorded. Only changes to the collection, and not
changes to the items themselves, will signal a change event.

Here is an example of an observable list. In the HTML, a template is rendered
with the contents from the timestamps list.

{% prettify html %}
{% insert code/observe_list.html 10 17 %}
{% endprettify %}

Here is the corresponding Dart code:

{% prettify dart %}
{% insert code/observe_list.dart %}
{% endprettify %}

Notice how timestamps is really a wrapped observable list. Any change to the
list, such as an add, remove, or clear, triggers the template in the HTML to be
re-rendered.

The toObservable() wrapper is shallow, in that it doesn't make all the
individual contents of a collection observable. If you want to observe the
changes to the items themselves, use @observable on the classes of the items
stored in the list.

### Live example
{: .no_toc}

<iframe width="500" height="100" src="code/out/observe_list.html"></iframe>

## Observing nested objects

Consider the case of a Person class that has a nested Address class. Use
@observable on both classes to ensure all fields on person and address are
observable.

Here is the Dart code:

{% prettify dart %}
{% insert code/observe_nested.dart %}
{% endprettify %}

And here is the HTML:

{% prettify html %}
{% insert code/observe_nested.html 10 18 %}
{% endprettify %}

### Live example
{: .no_toc}

<iframe width="500" height="200" src="code/out/observe_nested.html"></iframe>

## Expression Observers

We've talked about how the observable system tracks changes to variables,
fields, and collections. This is only half the story. To actually respond to the
change, you also need observers. An observer observes an observable expression
and runs a function when the expression changes.

Most of the time, you don't need to explicitly create observers because the dwc
transformer generates them for you (through bindings between HTML and observed
expressions). We don't recommend that you manually recreate the functionality of
bindings, but you can create your own observers when you need some code to
respond to changes.

To illustrate how observers work, let's manually recreate some of what the dwc
does for you.

Here is some HTML with a placeholder span element that gets updated when a
button is clicked.

{% prettify html %}
{% insert code/manual_observe.html 9 11 %}
{% endprettify %}

Here is the corresponding Dart code.

{% prettify dart %}
{% insert code/manual_observe.dart %}
{% endprettify %}

A new observer is created to watch the msg object. When msg changes, a
callback is run to update the span with a new message.

When a new observer is created, it first runs the expression to be observed. It
will detect each and every Observable field that was read by that expression,
and listen for changes to that field. If the final value is Observable, it
listens for any changes. This direct connection is one reason why Web UI's
observables are so efficient.

## What happens with @observable

<aside class="alert alert-info">
Note: this generated code was valid as of 2013/04/07.
Implementation details might have changed.
</aside>

Web UI includes a transformer, named Dart Web Compiler (dwc), that converts your
code into vanilla Dart and dart:html code so that it can ultimately be compiled
to vanilla JavaScript and HTML. The dwc  looks for @observable metadata,
and generates the appropriate getters and setters that record changes to fields,
variables, etc.

For example, here is a class Person that has @observable metadata:

{% prettify dart %}
{% insert code/observable_object.dart 4 9 %}
{% endprettify %}

Here is the generated Person class:

{% prettify dart %}
{% insert code/generated_01.dart %}
{% endprettify %}

Notice how the original name field is converted into setters and getters that
integrate the observable mechanics. This is where Web UI gets much of its
performance from, because it knows exactly what fields changed. Instead of
asking every single watched expression, "Did you change?", it knows exactly what
happened.

Thanks to Dart's getters and setters, consumers of the Person class are unaware
it changed. Getters and setters look like regular fields in Dart. Here is an
example:

{% prettify dart %}
{% insert code/observable_object.dart 11 14 %}
{% endprettify %}

As another example, here is an example of @observable with a top-level variable.

{% prettify dart %}
{% insert code/top_level_observable.dart %}
{% endprettify %}

Here is the generated code:

{% prettify dart %}
{% insert code/generated_02.dart %}
{% endprettify %}

Notice how you can have top-level getters and setters, too. Cool!

## How changes are propagated

When an observable variable, field, or collection is changed, the following
steps occur immediately:


1. The change is intercepted by the generated code.
1. A callback is scheduled to update any observers.
1. A record of the change is stored, including the object and its old and new value.
1. The data is actually changed.

Then, right before the end of the current event loop (in theory, before
painting), the following actions occur:

1. Loop through all the change records.
1. Notify observers that are connected to data that actually changed.
1. Observers do something with the new value (e.g. update some HTML).

The change propagation logic attempts to detect infinite loops to avoid
scenarios where one change triggers another change in a cycle.

## Summary

The Web UI package provides an efficient way to observe variables, classes,
fields, getters and setters, and even collections. The dwc  generates
code from `@observable` metadata, so that the system can track exactly what data
was changed. Observables and observers are used together to implement one-way
and two-way data bindings.
